### Course Description

Discover the universe: planets, stars, galaxies, and our place in the cosmos. This course builds a **foundational understanding of modern astronomy** — from how stars shine and die, to the Big Bang and the large-scale structure of the universe. Along the way, we'll explore black holes, dark matter, dark energy, nebulae, and other exotic objects.

*Statisfies the Physical Science [5A] General Education requirement.*

### Required Materials

- **Calculator:** Non-smartphone calculator for exams.

## Student Learning Outcomes {#sec-outcomes}

By the end of this course, students will be able to:


1. Interpret light as information — Use color, brightness, and spectra to infer basic properties of astronomical objects (temperature, composition, motion) and explain the physical reasoning behind each inference.

2. Explain and predict sky phenomena — Describe the causes of day/night, seasons, lunar phases, and eclipses using Sun–Earth–Moon geometry and Earth's axial tilt, supported by clear diagrams.

3. Apply physical principles to motion — Use gravity, inertia, and conservation laws to explain orbital motion and gravitational interactions, with simple scaling arguments to justify conclusions.

4. Reason quantitatively across scales — Work confidently with units, scientific notation, graphs, and proportional reasoning to interpret astronomical sizes, distances, times, and energies.

5. Connect stellar properties to physics — Relate a star's mass, color, luminosity, and lifetime to each other and to the underlying physics, and trace the major stages of stellar evolution from birth to remnant.

6. Describe how planets beyond our solar system are detected — Explain the basic principles behind methods like transits and radial velocity, and recognize what these observations can reveal about distant planetary systems.

7. Describe cosmic structure and history — Explain the evidence for galaxies, cosmic expansion, and the Big Bang framework, including why dark matter and dark energy are inferred from observations.

8. Evaluate astronomical claims critically — Distinguish observation from interpretation, identify assumptions and sources of uncertainty, and apply course concepts to assess misinformation and science-in-society issues.

### Course Components {#sec-components}

Per SDSU policy, students are expected to spend at least 6 hours per week (a minimum of 2 hours per course credit hour/unit) on coursework outside of class, including reading, homework, and exam preparation for this 3-unit course. [Click here for SDSU's explanation of *Credit Hour or Unit*.](https://catalog.sdsu.edu/content.php?catoid=10&navoid=924#credit-hour-or-unit).

**In this section:**

- [Scholarly Engagement](#sec-engagement)
- [Weekly Homework](#sec-homework)
- [LearningCurve Reading](#sec-learningcurve)
- [Exams](#sec-exams)

#### Scholarly Engagement (10%) {#sec-engagement}

Scholarly engagement measures how you make your reasoning visible through class participation and observable learning behaviors. Engagement is assessed through **iClicker responses** and **weekly observable behaviors**.

| Score | Observable Behaviors |
|:------|:---------------------|
| **5/5** | Prepared (specific questions on readings/notes), engaged in iClicker + activities, contributes to discussion, helps peers reason through problems, uses evidence/units/assumptions in explanations |
| **4/5** | Prepared, steady effort in activities, contributes occasionally, collaborates respectfully, asks questions when stuck |
| **3/5** | Inconsistent preparation, participates when prompted, limited collaboration/discussion contribution |
| **2/5** | Frequently unprepared or disengaged, minimal contribution to activities, distracts self/others |
| **1/5** | Rare attendance/engagement, unprepared when present, does not participate in activities |
| **0/5** | Habitual absence, no engagement |

This rubric is a guideline — your overall scholarly contribution matters more than conforming to a single engagement style.

Attendance is not formally taken, but you cannot earn engagement credit if you are not present and participating.

**Classroom norms:** Phones and off-task devices are not permitted during class. Be punctual. Treat classmates and the instructor with respect, and actively contribute to our learning community.

#### Weekly Homework (15%) {#sec-homework}

Homework is completed on **Macmillan Achieve** and is auto-graded. Assignments reinforce lecture material and prepare you for exams.

**Details:**

- **~10 assignments** throughout the semester
- **Due Tuesdays at 11:59 PM** via Achieve
- **5 attempts allowed** per question
- **Lowest 2 scores dropped** — this policy handles emergencies, so no extensions are granted
- Mix of multiple choice, numerical, and visual questions

**Bottom line:** Consistent practice builds exam readiness. The drop policy means you don't need to stress about one bad week.

#### LearningCurve Reading (10%) {#sec-learningcurve}

**LearningCurve** is an adaptive reading tool in Achieve. It adjusts to your level and helps you engage with the textbook before lecture.

**Details:**

- **Completion-based grading** — keep working until you reach the target
- **Unlimited attempts** — no penalty for wrong answers
- **All chapters available** throughout the semester

#### Exams (65% total) {#sec-exams}

There are two module exams (15% each) and one **cumulative** final exam (35%). Exams are **closed-note and closed-book**. You may use a **calculator** (no phones/smartwatches). A **course formula sheet** will be provided with the exam.

##### Missed Exams {#sec-missed-exams}

There are **no make-up exams** in this course. The only exception is a **serious, documented emergency** (e.g., hospitalization or a verified family emergency). In that case, a make-up may be offered **only at the instructor’s discretion** and may use a **different format** than the original exam. Travel, work obligations, scheduling conflicts, technical issues, or forgetting an exam do **not** qualify. An unexcused absence earns a **zero**.

*Final exam note:* SDSU’s policy states that **no final exam may be given to individual students before the regular scheduled time**; if it is impossible to take the final as scheduled, arrangements must be made with the instructor (typically via an **Incomplete/deferred final** process or **withdrawal** from the course, when applicable). ([Spring 2026 Final Exam Calendar](https://registrar.sdsu.edu/calendars/finals/spring-2026))

## Academic Integrity & AI Policy {#sec-ai-policy}

All submitted work must reflect **your own understanding**. Collaboration is encouraged for discussing concepts, but what you submit must represent your own reasoning and understanding. Violations will be handled according to [university procedures](https://sacd.sdsu.edu/student-rights/academic-dishonesty/cheating-and-plagiarism).

### Course-Provided AI Tools (Approved) {#sec-approved-ai}

::: {.callout-tip}
## Approved AI Tools

**Achieve AI Tutor** — Enabled for homework support. This Socratic-style tutor asks guiding questions to help you think through problems; it won't give you answers. Use it when you're stuck and need a nudge. Your submitted work must still reflect your own reasoning.

**ASTR 101 NotebookLM** — The instructor may also provide a private notebook grounded in course materials only (invitation via email). Use for reviewing concepts, not generating solutions.
:::

### External AI Tools (Not Allowed for Graded Work) {#sec-external-ai}

::: {.callout-important}
## External AI Rules

**Do not use** ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, or similar tools to produce, rewrite, or "polish" anything you submit. These tools can generate fluent explanations that are subtly wrong — and in a physical science course, "sounds right" isn't a standard of truth.

**Allowed for studying:**

- Clarifying your own notes or assigned readings
- Generating practice questions (not answers to assigned problems)
- Explaining concepts at a different level

**Not allowed:**

- Generating or rewriting homework solutions you submit
- Submitting reasoning you cannot reproduce on your own
:::

## Course Materials (Sharing Policy) {#sec-materials}

Lecture notes, slides, homework assignments, and exams are the intellectual property of the instructor. You may use course materials for your own educational purposes in this course, but you may not reproduce, distribute, share, or post them on any public platform (e.g., Chegg, Course Hero, Discord servers, public GitHub repos) without written permission.

Unauthorized recording or redistribution of class sessions or office hours is prohibited.

## Communication & Getting Help {#sec-communication}

All course-related communication should be sent through Canvas messaging when possible. Include “ASTR 101” in the subject line. I aim to respond within 24-48 hours on weekdays. **Before emailing, check this syllabus and recent Canvas announcements.**

If you encounter difficulties with the assignments or find yourself falling behind, please seek help immediately by:

- Posting your questions on the course *Canvas* discussion page.
- Speaking with the instructor during class or office hours (preferred).
- Collaborating with classmates (while ensuring your final submission reflects your own understanding).
- Attending SDSU’s *Astronomy Help Room* for free tutoring (schedule posted on Canvas).

### Getting Help (Office Hours) {#sec-getting-help}

Office hours are for learning — bring what you’ve tried (notes, attempts, questions) and we’ll work from there. I’ll often guide you by asking questions so you build your own problem-solving skills. You’re welcome to come even if you’re not sure what to ask or have non-course related questions.

## Fostering a Growth Mindset {#sec-growth-mindset}

A **growth mindset** is the belief that intelligence, abilities, and talents are malleable and can be developed through effort and persistence, not fixed traits you're born with. This mindset is key for succeeding in this course. In ASTR 101, you'll encounter challenging concepts that may initially seem overwhelming. **This is normal and expected: it means you're learning.**

*Trust the process, embrace the challenge, and discover that you're capable of doing hard things.*

## Diversity and Inclusivity Statement {#sec-inclusion}

I consider this classroom to be a place where you will be treated with respect, and I welcome individuals of all ages, backgrounds, beliefs, ethnicities, genders, gender identities, gender expressions, national origins, religious affiliations, sexual orientations, ability, and other visible and non-visible differences. All members of this class are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming and inclusive environment for every other member of the class.

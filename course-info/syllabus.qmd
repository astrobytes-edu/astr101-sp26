### Course Description

Directed toward students with a *strong interest* in science and mathematics. This course builds a foundational and quantitative understanding of modern astronomy, spanning: how we infer physical properties from light; gravity and orbital motion; stars and stellar evolution; the interstellar medium and star/planet formation; galaxies and dark matter; and cosmology.

**Prerequisite:** Satisfaction of the SDSU Mathematics/Quantitative Reasoning Assessment requirement.

**Important:** This is a **quantitative** course: we’ll use math to build **physical understanding and intuition**, not rote memorization or “plug-and-chug.” You’ll practice interpreting equations, stating assumptions, and sanity-checking results (units, limits, scaling); as a required course for Astronomy pre-majors, ASTR 101 is also designed to prepare you for **upper-division Physics and Astronomy** coursework through scientific modeling, quantitative reasoning, and clear scientific explanation.


::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Core Course Throughline

Astronomers collect photons for a living. The challenge: translate limited observations into physical understanding — build models, quantify what we know (and don't), test whether those models explain what we see. 

*Modern astronomy **is** astrophysics: inferring physical reality from constrained measurements.*
Astrophysics is the interplay between theory and observation - theorists *predict*, observers *test*, and the loop continues.
:::

## Student Learning Outcomes {#sec-outcomes}

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Infer** the physical properties of celestial objects from electromagnetic radiation by **analyzing wavelength, intensity, and spectral features**, and by **explicitly connecting observed signals to underlying physical processes**.

2. Apply fundamental physical principles — including gravity, conservation laws, and orbital mechanics — to **analyze and quantitatively justify** the motions and interactions of celestial bodies in the solar system and beyond.

3. **Construct and evaluate simplified physical models** of stars and planets using blackbody radiation, spectral lines, and Doppler shifts, and **assess the assumptions and limitations of those models**.

4. **Reason from initial conditions** — such as stellar mass and composition — to predict and explain stellar lifecycles, explicitly linking gravity, nuclear fusion, and energy balance to observed evolutionary outcomes.

5. **Infer** the structure, mass distribution, and evolution of galaxies from **observational evidence** — such as rotation curves and luminosity profiles — **and evaluate the necessity of dark matter** in explaining galactic dynamics.

6. **Analyze cosmological observations and scaling relations** to develop a physically grounded understanding of the origin, evolution, and large-scale structure of the Universe, including the roles of dark energy and cosmic expansion.

7. Demonstrate how astronomical observations are used to **construct, test, refine, and falsify physical models**, and **articulate how uncertainty, assumptions, and observational limits shape scientific conclusions**.

8. **Use quantitative reasoning and physical principles developed in astronomy** to critically evaluate scientific claims, identify disinformation, and assess real-world challenges involving energy, climate, and space-related science.

### Course Components {#sec-components}

Per SDSU policy, students are expected to spend at least 6 hours per week (a minimum of 2 hours per course credit hour/unit) on coursework outside of class, including reading, homework, and exam preparation for this 3-unit course. [Click here for SDSU's explanation of *Credit Hour or Unit*.](https://catalog.sdsu.edu/content.php?catoid=10&navoid=924#credit-hour-or-unit).

**In this section:**

- [Scholarly Engagement](#sec-engagement)
- [Weekly Homework](#sec-homework)
- [LearningCurve Reading](#sec-learningcurve)
- [Exams](#sec-exams)

#### Scholarly Engagement (10%) {#sec-engagement}

Engagement is measured through **iClicker responses** during lecture and **Friday in-class activities**.

**Scoring:**

- **75% participation** — you answered the questions
- **25% correctness** — you got them right

**To earn credit:**

- Must answer at least 75% of questions in a class period
- Attendance is not formally taken, but you cannot earn credit if you're not present

**Friday activities:** Hands-on practice applying lecture concepts. Activities are designed to be completed during class time with your peers.

**Classroom norms:** Phones and off-task devices are not permitted during class. Respect your classmates and contribute to our learning community.

#### Weekly Homework (15%) {#sec-homework}

Homework is completed on **Macmillan Achieve** and is auto-graded. Assignments reinforce lecture material and prepare you for exams.

**Details:**

- **10 assignments** throughout the semester
- **Due Tuesdays at 11:59 PM** via Achieve
- **5 attempts allowed** per question
- **Lowest 2 scores dropped** — this policy handles emergencies, so no extensions are granted
- Mix of multiple choice, numerical, and visual questions

**Bottom line:** Consistent practice builds exam readiness. The drop policy means you don't need to stress about one bad week.

#### LearningCurve Reading (10%) {#sec-learningcurve}

**LearningCurve** is an adaptive reading tool in Achieve. It adjusts to your level and helps you engage with the textbook before lecture.

**Details:**

- **Completion-based grading** — keep working until you reach the target
- **Unlimited attempts** — no penalty for wrong answers
- **All chapters available** throughout the semester

#### Exams (65% total) {#sec-exams}

There are two module exams (15% each) and one **cumulative** final exam (35%). Exams are **closed-note and closed-book**. You may use a **calculator** (no phones/smartwatches). A **course formula sheet** will be provided with the exam.

##### Missed Exams {#sec-missed-exams}

There are **no make-up exams** in this course. The only exception is a **serious, documented emergency** (e.g., hospitalization or a verified family emergency). In that case, a make-up may be offered **only at the instructor’s discretion** and may use a **different format** than the original exam. Travel, work obligations, scheduling conflicts, technical issues, or forgetting an exam do **not** qualify. An unexcused absence earns a **zero**.

*Final exam note:* SDSU’s policy states that **no final exam may be given to individual students before the regular scheduled time**; if it is impossible to take the final as scheduled, arrangements must be made with the instructor (typically via an **Incomplete/deferred final** process or **withdrawal** from the course, when applicable). ([Spring 2026 Final Exam Calendar](https://registrar.sdsu.edu/calendars/finals/spring-2026))

## Academic Integrity & Generative AI Policy {#sec-ai-policy}

All submitted work in this course must reflect **your own understanding**. Collaboration is strongly encouraged to discuss concepts and strategies. However, what you submit must be written independently and must represent your unique reasoning. Copying solutions (from classmates, the internet, generative AI, or solution manuals) is not permitted. Violations of academic integrity will be handled according to university procedures and may be reported to the [Center for Student Rights and Responsibilities](https://sacd.sdsu.edu/student-rights/academic-dishonesty/cheating-and-plagiarism).

### Generative AI (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.) {#sec-generative-ai}

::: {.callout-important}
## Generative AI rules (enforced)

- **Do not use** general-purpose AI tools to produce, rewrite, or “polish” anything you submit for a grade.
- **Disclose AI use** whenever a submission asks for AI/collaboration disclosure (e.g., homework grade memos), even if the use was allowed.
- You are responsible for correctness and for being able to reproduce any reasoning you submit.

**Allowed (study support):**
- Asking questions to clarify *your own notes* or *assigned readings*.
- Generating practice questions (not answers to assigned problems).
- Explaining concepts at a different level *for studying*, not for submission.

**Not allowed (graded work):**
- Generating or rewriting homework solutions, derivations, or written explanations you submit.
- Submitting AI-generated reasoning you cannot reproduce on your own.
:::

Generative AI can produce fluent explanations and plausible-looking solutions that are subtly wrong. In a quantitative, model-based course, “sounds right” is not a standard of truth. If you don’t have the physics and quantitative discipline to verify an AI output, you risk learning the wrong thing confidently.

To support effective studying, I will provide course-specific tools grounded in **course materials only** (lecture notes, textbook, vetted sources), that includes a private **ASTR 101 NotebookLM notebook** (invitation via your email address linked to Canvas). This resource is intended as study aids — not solution engines.

## Course Materials (Sharing Policy) {#sec-materials}

Lecture notes, slides, homework assignments, and exams are the intellectual property of the instructor. You may use course materials for your own educational purposes in this course, but you may not reproduce, distribute, share, or post them on any public platform (e.g., Chegg, Course Hero, Discord servers, public GitHub repos) without written permission.

Unauthorized recording or redistribution of class sessions or office hours is prohibited.

## Communication & Getting Help {#sec-communication}

All course-related communication should be sent through Canvas messaging when possible. Include “ASTR 101” in the subject line. I aim to respond within 24-48 hours on weekdays. **Before emailing, check this syllabus and recent Canvas announcements.**

If you encounter difficulties with the assignments or find yourself falling behind, please seek help immediately by:

- Posting your questions on the course *Canvas* discussion page.
- Speaking with the instructor during class or office hours (preferred).
- Collaborating with classmates (while ensuring your final submission reflects your own understanding).
- Attending SDSU’s *Astronomy Help Room* for free tutoring (schedule posted on Canvas).

### Getting Help (Office Hours) {#sec-getting-help}

Office hours are for learning — bring what you’ve tried (notes, attempts, questions) and we’ll work from there. I’ll often guide you by asking questions so you build your own problem-solving skills. You’re welcome to come even if you’re not sure what to ask or have non-course related questions.

## Fostering a Growth Mindset {#sec-growth-mindset}

A **growth mindset** is the belief that intelligence, abilities, and talents are malleable and can be developed through effort and persistence, not fixed traits you're born with. This mindset is key for succeeding in this course. In ASTR 101, you'll encounter challenging concepts that may initially seem overwhelming. **This is normal and expected: it means you're learning.**

*Trust the process, embrace the challenge, and discover that you're capable of doing hard things.*

## Diversity and Inclusivity Statement {#sec-inclusion}

I consider this classroom to be a place where you will be treated with respect, and I welcome individuals of all ages, backgrounds, beliefs, ethnicities, genders, gender identities, gender expressions, national origins, religious affiliations, sexual orientations, ability, and other visible and non-visible differences. All members of this class are expected to contribute to a respectful, welcoming and inclusive environment for every other member of the class.

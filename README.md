Reference conversions/definitions (if you want to cite them in notes/handouts): dyne ([Wikipedia][1]), erg ([qudt.org][2]), barye ([qudt.org][3]), gauss↔tesla ([NIST][4]) and gauss = maxwell/cm² ([Wikipedia][5]), maxwell↔weber ([Wikipedia][6]), poise ([Wikipedia][7]), stokes ([NIST][8]).

### Make it reusable across *all* decks (recommended)

1. Save that slide into a file like: `slides/_includes/_cgs-cheatsheet.qmd`
   (Files starting with `_` are not rendered as standalone targets by default.) ([Quarto][9])
2. In any deck, include it on its own line with blank lines around it:

```markdown
{{< include /slides/_includes/_cgs-cheatsheet.qmd >}}
```

Include shortcodes behave like copy/paste and should be alone on a line; also, absolute-to-project-root paths (`/…`) avoid the path weirdness you’ve already encountered.

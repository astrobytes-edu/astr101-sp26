## Recommended “Astro Lab” flow (Friday)

If you’re running a rotation lab across all four demos, start here:

- Capstone rotation + synthesis: `/demos/_instructor/cosmic-playground/capstone.html`

## Using Demos in Class

### Lecture Mode
Open the demo fullscreen on the projector and demonstrate concepts live. All demos support:

- Keyboard navigation (arrow keys, Enter)
- Touch/mouse interaction
- Responsive sizing

### Student Exploration
Share direct URLs for homework or in-class activities. Demos work on phones, tablets, and computers.

### Embedding in Activities
Use the `demo` shortcode to embed demos inline in Quarto documents:

```markdown
{{</* demo angular-size */>}}
{{</* demo moon-phases height="450px" */>}}
```

The `height` parameter is optional (default: 500px).

## Pedagogical Notes

### Angular Size

**Key misconception:** Students often think angular size is just about distance.

**Teaching points:**

- Start with "Why do Sun and Moon look the same size?"
- The 400× size / 400× distance coincidence enables total eclipses
- Moon recession means this won't last forever
- Thumb at arm's length ≈ 2° is a useful reference

**Good questions:**

- If Moon were half as far, how would angular size change?
- Why do we measure galaxies in degrees but planets in arcseconds?

### Moon Phases

**Key misconception:** Phases are caused by Earth's shadow.

**Teaching points:**

- Phases are geometry (viewing angle), not shadows
- Earth's shadow only touches Moon during eclipses (~2×/year)
- "Quarter" refers to orbit position, not illumination fraction
- Have students predict phase before dragging

**Demo sequence:** New → First Quarter → Full → Third Quarter

### Eclipse Geometry

**Key misconception:** Eclipses should happen every month.

**Teaching points:**

- The 5° orbital tilt is why eclipses don't happen monthly
- Nodes are where Moon's orbit crosses ecliptic
- Set tilt to 0° to show what would happen without it
- Run 1000-year simulation to demonstrate frequency

**Numbers to know:**

- Solar eclipses: 2–5 per year (but narrow path)
- Lunar eclipses: 0–3 per year (visible from half Earth)

### Seasons

**Key misconception:** Seasons are caused by distance from Sun.

**Teaching points:**

- Earth is CLOSEST to Sun in January (Northern winter!)
- If distance caused seasons, both hemispheres would have summer together
- Tilt causes: (1) longer days, (2) more direct sunlight
- Compare Earth (23.5°) to Uranus (98°) for extreme contrast

**Killer question:** "If distance causes seasons, why is it winter in the Northern Hemisphere when Earth is closest to the Sun?"

## Technical Notes

**Stack:** Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript — no frameworks, no server required.

**Portability:** Each demo is self-contained. Copy the folder anywhere and it works.

**Accessibility:**

- Keyboard navigable
- Screen reader labels (aria-label attributes)
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`

**Source:** Each demo lives in `/demos/<name>/index.html`

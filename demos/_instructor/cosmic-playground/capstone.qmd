::: {.callout-roadmap title="Instructor goals for this lab"}
Make the four demos feel like one coherent “geometry toolkit,” not four disconnected topics. Every station produces evidence that is required for the final synthesis.
:::

## Logistics (suggested)

**Total time:** 50–75 minutes (flexible)  
**Groups:** 3–4 students  
**Devices:** 1 per group (phone/tablet/laptop)  
**Deliverable:** one concept map or one CER paragraph + station evidence table

## Rotation schedule (default 70 minutes)

- 4 stations × 10 minutes = 40 min  
  - 7 min station work + 3 min transition/check-in
- 20 min synthesis + write-up
- 10 min debrief

If you only have 50 minutes, run 4×8 min stations and a shorter synthesis (12 min).

## Station “Model Card” template (students fill in at every station)

Copy/paste or print this template for each station:

| Field | Your station notes |
|---|---|
| Controls (what we change) |  |
| Observables (what we read) |  |
| Governing relationship (equation or rule, in words) |  |
| One sanity check (limit case or units) |  |
| One connection sentence to the next station |  |

## Station 1: Seasons

**URL:** `/demos/seasons/`  
**Focus:** tilt $\varepsilon$ → declination $\delta$ → day length + noon altitude

**Task:** At latitude 40°N, record day length and noon altitude at June solstice and December solstice. Then set tilt to 0° and record what changes.

**Required connection sentence:** “This is a geometry story because changing an angle changes an observable (day length/noon altitude).”

## Station 2: Moon phases

**URL:** `/demos/moon-phases/`  
**Focus:** phase angle $\alpha$ → illumination fraction $f$

**Task:** Record illumination (%) at New, First Quarter, Full, Third Quarter. Then answer: “Why does ‘quarter’ not mean 25% illuminated?”

**Required connection sentence:** “Phases are geometry, not shadow — but eclipses *do* involve shadows.”

## Station 3: Angular size

**URL:** `/demos/angular-size/`  
**Focus:** $d/D$ → angular diameter $\theta$

**Task:** Compare Sun and Moon angular sizes. Then vary Moon distance in orbit mode and record the min/max angular size.

**Required connection sentence:** “Eclipses depend on alignment, but what we *see* (total vs not) depends on angular size.”

## Station 4: Eclipse geometry

**URL:** `/demos/eclipse-geometry/`  
**Focus:** syzygy (New/Full) + near-node ($|\beta|$ small) → eclipse type

**Task:** Produce:
1) One example of New Moon with no eclipse (far from node)  
2) One example of New Moon with a solar eclipse (near a node)  
3) One example of Full Moon with a penumbral or umbral lunar eclipse

**Required connection sentence:** “Eclipses are a constrained intersection of phase geometry and near-plane geometry.”

## Synthesis (the “put it all together” moment)

Choose one of these synthesis deliverables:

### Option A: Concept map (recommended)

**Constraint:** Your map must include at least one arrow labeled with an equation/rule from each station.

Required nodes (minimum):

- Tilt $\varepsilon$  
- Declination $\delta$  
- Phase angle $\alpha$  
- Illumination fraction $f$  
- Angular diameter $\theta$  
- Ecliptic latitude $|\beta|$ / node proximity  
- Eclipse type (none/partial/central; penumbral/umbral/total)

### Option B: CER paragraph

**Claim (given):** “Total solar eclipses are possible now because of a coincidence in angular size, but eclipses are rare because geometry adds multiple constraints.”

**Evidence requirement:** At least one measured value or screenshot from **each** demo.

**Reasoning requirement:** The reasoning must include:
- a tilt statement (Seasons),
- a phase statement (Moon phases),
- a ratio statement (Angular size),
- and a “two conditions” statement (Eclipses).

## Debrief prompts (whole class)

1) “What was the common structure across all four stations?” (controls → observables → rule)  
2) “Where did our intuition fail until the model constrained it?”  
3) “Which single equation/rule felt most powerful, and why?”

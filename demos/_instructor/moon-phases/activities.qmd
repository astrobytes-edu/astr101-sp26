## MW Quick Exploration (3–5 min, pairs)

::: {.callout-tps title="TPS: Why is ‘quarter’ half-lit?"}
**Think (30 s):** “Does ‘First Quarter’ mean the Moon is 25% illuminated?”  

**Pair (60 s):** Agree on what “quarter” refers to instead.  

**Share (1–2 min):** Use the demo:
1) Jump to **New Moon** and then **First Quarter**.  
2) Read the illumination percent.  
3) Point at the orbit: “First quarter” is one quarter of the way around the orbit from New Moon.

**Debrief script:** “Quarter is an orbital position label. Illumination is controlled by geometry; at quarter phases, we see half of the lit hemisphere.”
:::

## MW Short Investigation (8–12 min, pairs/triads)

::: {.callout-problem title="Investigation: Build the illumination curve"}
**Task:** Pick 8 angles evenly spaced around the orbit (e.g., 0°, 45°, 90°, …, 315°). For each, record:
- Phase name
- Illumination (%)
- Days since new

**Prompt:** “How does illumination change with time? Is it linear?”

**Expected pattern:** Illumination changes smoothly but not linearly with angle (it follows a cosine relationship).
:::

::: {.callout-summary title="Share-out (2–3 min)"}
Have one group describe the “shape” of illumination vs time (slow near New/Full, fastest near the quarters). Connect to the cosine in the model.
:::

## Friday Astro Lab (20–30+ min, groups of 3–4)

::: {.callout-problem title="Astro Lab: Phases are geometry, not shadow"}
**Deliverable:** One-page explanation + evidence table.

**Claim (given):** “Moon phases are not caused by Earth’s shadow.”

**Evidence (from the demo):**
1) A table showing illumination at the four key phases.  
2) A diagram (sketch) of the Sun–Earth–Moon geometry at New, First Quarter, Full, Third Quarter.  
3) One “shadow check”: show that Earth’s shadow points away from the Sun and is only relevant for eclipses, not most phases.

**Reasoning:** Use the “two halves” story: illuminated half is fixed by sunlight; visible half is fixed by where we are; the overlap is the phase.

**Bridge to eclipses (1 sentence):** “Eclipses require New/Full Moon *and* being near a node — phases alone don’t guarantee an eclipse.”
:::

## Station version (for the Cosmic Playground capstone rotation)

::: {.callout-problem title="Station card: Moon Phases (6–8 minutes)"}
**Demo setup:** start at New → First Quarter → Full → Third Quarter.

**Your station artifact (fill in):**
1) **Control(s):** Moon angle $\alpha$  
2) **Observable(s):** phase name, illumination fraction $f$  
3) **Governing relationship:** write $f=\frac{1+\cos\alpha}{2}$ in words  
4) **Sanity check:** what is $f$ at $\alpha=90^\circ$?  
5) **Connection sentence:** “This matters for eclipses/totality because…”

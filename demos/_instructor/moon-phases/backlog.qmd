::: {.callout-roadmap title="How to use this backlog"}
This is a planning guide. “Physics” items should improve correctness *without* adding cognitive clutter.
:::

| Priority | Impact | Effort | Category | Notes | Code entrypoint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| P0 | High | Low | UX | Add an on-screen “Sun direction” arrow label so the geometry story is explicit. | `demos/moon-phases/index.html` |
| P0 | High | Medium | Physics | Load and use `demos/_assets/moon-phases-model.js` in the demo (single source of truth for illumination equation). | `demos/moon-phases/index.html` + `demos/moon-phases/moon-phases.js` |
| P1 | High | Medium | Pedagogy | Add built-in “prediction checkpoints” in Challenge Mode aligned to common misconceptions. | `demos/moon-phases/moon-phases.js` |
| P1 | Medium | Medium | Physics | Add a simple 3D inclination toggle that hands off to Eclipse Geometry concepts (“phases vs eclipses”). | `demos/moon-phases/moon-phases.js` |
| P1 | Medium | Medium | UX | Add rise/set time intuition (e.g., “Full Moon rises at sunset”) as optional overlay. | `demos/moon-phases/moon-phases.js` |
| P2 | Medium | Low | Accessibility | Add reduced-motion support that defaults to step mode when `prefers-reduced-motion` is set. | `demos/moon-phases/moon-phases.js` |
| P2 | Low | Low | Pedagogy | Expand the assessment bank after the first teaching pilot (add 2–4 distractor-driven clickers). | `demos/_instructor/moon-phases/assessment.qmd` |

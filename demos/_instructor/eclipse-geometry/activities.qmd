## MW Quick Exploration (3–5 min, pairs)

::: {.callout-tps title="TPS: Two conditions, not one"}
**Think (30 s):** “Which is more important for a solar eclipse: New Moon, or being near a node?”  

**Pair (60 s):** Decide whether either condition alone is sufficient.

**Share (1–2 min):** Use the demo:
1) Click **New Moon** (phase correct) but keep the Moon away from nodes → no eclipse.  
2) Drag the Moon near a node but away from New/Full → no eclipse.  
3) Do both → eclipse.

**Debrief script:** “Eclipses are constrained by *two* geometric conditions: phase + node proximity.”
:::

## MW Short Investigation (8–12 min, pairs/triads)

::: {.callout-problem title="Investigation: Eclipse seasons are clusters"}
**Task:** Use **Animate 1 Year** (or run a ~10-year sim on Normal speed) and record the *times* when eclipses occur.

**Prompt:** “Do eclipses happen evenly spaced, or in clusters? How far apart are the clusters?”

**Expected pattern:** Eclipses cluster in seasons separated by about half a year (because the Sun must be near a node for New/Full to line up with the plane crossing).
:::

::: {.callout-summary title="Share-out (2–3 min)"}
Ask groups to report “how many eclipses per season” and “roughly how far apart seasons are.” Then connect back to the node geometry and the Sun’s motion around the ecliptic.
:::

## Friday Astro Lab (20–30+ min, groups of 3–4)

::: {.callout-problem title="Astro Lab: How does orbital tilt control eclipse frequency?"}
**Deliverable:** A short report (table + claim + reasoning).

**Setup:** Assign each group a tilt value (e.g., 0°, 2°, 5°, 8°).

**Task:** For your tilt:
1) Run a **100-year** simulation (or 10 years if time is tight).  
2) Record counts for solar and lunar eclipses (including penumbral).  
3) Describe how eclipse seasons change as tilt increases.

**Claim prompt:** “Increasing tilt makes eclipses [more/less] frequent because…”

**Reasoning cue:** the node window in longitude narrows as the inclination increases (harder to stay close to the plane at syzygy).

**ASTR 201 extension (optional):** Use the ecliptic latitude equation $\beta=\arcsin(\sin i\sin(\lambda-\Omega))$ to explain why the maximum possible $|\beta|$ is $i$.
:::

## Station version (for the Cosmic Playground capstone rotation)

::: {.callout-problem title="Station card: Eclipse Geometry (6–8 minutes)"}
**Demo setup:** Use **New Moon** and **Full Moon** buttons; drag near/far from nodes.

**Your station artifact (fill in):**
1) **Control(s):** phase angle $\Delta$, node proximity (nearest-node distance or $|\beta|$), tilt $i$  
2) **Observable(s):** eclipse type (none/partial/central; penumbral/umbral/total)  
3) **Governing relationship:** write “eclipse requires syzygy + small $|\beta|$” in words  
4) **Sanity check:** what happens when $i=0^\circ$?  
5) **Connection sentence:** “This connects to angular size because…”

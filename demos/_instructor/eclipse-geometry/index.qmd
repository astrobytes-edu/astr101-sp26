## Why this demo exists

::: {.callout-why-this-matters}
Students can correctly say “eclipses happen at New or Full Moon,” and still expect them to happen every month. This demo adds the missing geometric condition: the Moon must also be near a **node** (close to the ecliptic plane). That second constraint is the reason eclipses come in “seasons” rather than every month.
:::

## Learning goals (ASTR 101)

Students should be able to:

- State the **two necessary conditions** for eclipses:
  1) correct phase (New for solar, Full for lunar) and
  2) near a node (near the ecliptic plane).
- Use the demo readouts (phase label, ecliptic latitude, node distance) to explain “no eclipse” cases.
- Recognize that “penumbral vs umbral vs total” is about how close the alignment is.

## 10–15 minute live-teach script (projector)

1. Start at defaults. Click **Full Moon**. Ask: *“Do we always get a lunar eclipse at full moon?”* Show the “NO ECLIPSE” status when the Moon is not near the ecliptic.

2. Drag the Moon to a node while staying at Full Moon. Ask: *“What changed?”* Highlight the **Nearest node** readout and the eclipse status.

3. Repeat at **New Moon** for solar eclipses. Emphasize that “New Moon” happens monthly, but “near a node” does not.

4. Set orbital tilt to **0°**. Ask: *“What would happen to eclipses?”* Use this counterfactual to cement the causal role of inclination.

5. Run **Animate 1 Year** (or the long-run simulation at ~10 years) to show eclipse seasons as clustering in time.

## Suggested connections to the other demos

- **Moon phases:** phases tell you *when* eclipses are possible (New/Full), but not *whether* they happen.
- **Angular size:** totality depends on angular size; eclipse geometry depends on alignment.
- **Seasons:** both are “tilt + geometry” stories; learning to read angles is the transferable skill.

## MW Quick Exploration (3–5 min, pairs)

::: {.callout-tps title="TPS: Distance vs tilt (fast misconception check)"}
**Think (30 s):** “If Earth is closer to the Sun, should it be summer everywhere on Earth?”  

**Pair (60 s):** Decide what the Southern Hemisphere’s season *must* be if the Northern Hemisphere is in summer.  

**Share (1–2 min):** Use the demo to check the prediction:
1) Click **June Solstice** → point out “Season (North)” vs “Season (South)”.  
2) Read the **Earth–Sun Distance** value and ask: “Is this the *minimum* distance of the year?”  
3) Click **December Solstice** and compare distance again.

**Debrief script:** “Distance changes a little, but the hemispheres are opposite. That single fact tells us distance cannot be the driver of seasons.”

## MW Short Investigation (8–12 min, pairs/triads)

::: {.callout-problem title="Investigation: What actually changes between seasons?"}
**Setup:** Keep **Axial Tilt = 23.5°**. Assign each group a latitude (e.g., 0°, 23.5°, 40°, 66.5°, 80°).

**Task:** For your latitude, record these readouts at:
- March equinox
- June solstice
- September equinox
- December solstice

Record:
- Day length (hours)
- Noon Sun altitude (degrees)

**Prompt:** “Which of these two changes matters more for warming: longer days or higher noon altitude?”

**Expected pattern:** As latitude increases, the *swing* in both day length and noon altitude gets larger (eventually reaching 24 h / 0 h extremes).
:::

::: {.callout-summary title="Share-out (2–3 min)"}
Each group reports one sentence: “At latitude $\phi$, summer vs winter changes day length by ___ and noon altitude by ___.” Then we summarize: tilt changes *both* “how long” and “how direct.”
:::

## Friday Astro Lab (20–30+ min, groups of 3–4)

::: {.callout-problem title="Astro Lab: Build an evidence-based seasons explanation"}
**Deliverable:** One-page CER (Claim–Evidence–Reasoning) or concept map.

**Claim (given):** “Axial tilt is the primary cause of seasons on Earth.”

**Evidence (from the demo):**
1) A data table for one latitude showing day length and noon altitude at the four anchor dates.
2) A “tilt = 0°” control test showing the seasonal cycle collapses.
3) A short note showing perihelion is in early January and therefore distance cannot explain Northern Hemisphere summer.

**Reasoning:** Use the model language: connect the observed changes to declination $\delta$, and connect $\delta$ to tilt $\varepsilon$.

**ASTR 201 extension (optional):** Explain (in words) why the sunrise/sunset condition becomes $\cos H_0 = -\tan\phi\tan\delta$, and how that produces 24 h/0 h behavior near the poles.

## Station version (for the Cosmic Playground capstone rotation)

::: {.callout-problem title="Station card: Seasons (6–8 minutes)"}
**Demo setup:** defaults → then click **June Solstice** and **December Solstice**.

**Your station artifact (fill in):**
1) **Control(s):** tilt $\varepsilon$, day of year, latitude $\phi$  
2) **Observable(s):** day length, noon altitude, season labels  
3) **Governing relationship:** write one sentence connecting $\varepsilon$ → $\delta$ → day length  
4) **Sanity check:** what happens when $\varepsilon=0^\circ$?  
5) **Connection sentence:** “This matters for eclipses/phases because…”

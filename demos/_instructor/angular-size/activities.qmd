## MW Quick Exploration (3–5 min, pairs)

::: {.callout-tps title="TPS: The Sun–Moon coincidence"}
**Think (30 s):** “Which looks larger in the sky: the Sun or the Moon?”  

**Pair (60 s):** Decide whether you expect their angular sizes to differ by a lot, a little, or be about the same.

**Share (1–2 min):** Use the demo:
1) Select **Sun** preset → read the angular size.  
2) Select **Moon (Today)** preset → read the angular size.  
3) Ask: “What does this imply about total solar eclipses?”

**Debrief script:** “It’s a coincidence: the Sun is ~400× larger but also ~400× farther, so the ratios nearly cancel.”

## MW Short Investigation (8–12 min, pairs/triads)

::: {.callout-problem title="Investigation: Scaling without a calculator"}
**Task:** Pick one object (e.g., the Moon preset). Then do three controlled changes and predict first:

1) Double the distance $D$ (keep diameter fixed).  
2) Halve the distance.  
3) Double the diameter $d$ (keep distance fixed).

For each, record the angular size and write one proportional-reasoning sentence like: “When $D$ doubles, $\theta$ roughly halves.”

**Expected pattern:** $\theta \propto d/D$ for small angles.

## Friday Astro Lab (20–30+ min, groups of 3–4)

::: {.callout-problem title="Astro Lab: When are total solar eclipses possible?"}
**Deliverable:** A short written claim with evidence + a “future Moon” graph.

**Part 1 (evidence table):** Record angular sizes for:
- Sun
- Moon (today)
- Moon at perigee-like and apogee-like settings (orbit mode)

**Part 2 (recession):** Switch to Moon “recession time” mode. Choose two future times (e.g., +500 Myr and +1000 Myr). Record Moon angular size at each.

**Prompt:** “At what point does the Moon become too small to ever fully cover the Sun?”  

**Reasoning cue:** totality requires $\theta_{\text{Moon}} \gtrsim \theta_{\text{Sun}}$ (plus alignment from the eclipse demo).

**ASTR 201 extension (optional):** Compare the exact formula $\theta = 2\arctan(d/2D)$ to the small-angle approximation $\theta\approx d/D$ and estimate the fractional error for the Moon.

## Station version (for the Cosmic Playground capstone rotation)

::: {.callout-problem title="Station card: Angular Size (6–8 minutes)"}
**Demo setup:** Compare **Sun** and **Moon (Today)**; then toggle Moon orbit mode.

**Your station artifact (fill in):**
1) **Control(s):** diameter $d$, distance $D$  
2) **Observable(s):** angular diameter $\theta$ (°/′/″)  
3) **Governing relationship:** write $\theta = 2\arctan(d/2D)$ in words  
4) **Sanity check:** what happens to $\theta$ if $D$ doubles?  
5) **Connection sentence:** “This matters for eclipses because…”

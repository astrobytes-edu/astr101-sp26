## [Main Section 1: First Major Concept]

{{< fig [figure-id-if-applicable] >}}

### [Subsection: Key Definition or Framework]

[Introduce the core concept. Use paragraph-first structure, not bullet lists.]

[Second paragraph that builds on the first. Include any necessary definitions.]

**[Key term]:** [Definition in plain language, then technical precision.]

### [Subsection: The Details]

[Detailed explanation. Walk through the reasoning step by step.]

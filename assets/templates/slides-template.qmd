## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

::: {.incremental}
- [First objective - use action verbs: explain, calculate, derive, compare...]
- [Second objective]
- [Third objective]
:::

::: {.notes}
Read these aloud. Students should write them down or note them.
Estimated time: 1–2 min.
:::

## {background-image="/assets/images/common/noirlab-nightsky-mosaic.jpg" background-opacity="0.2"}

::: {.r-fit-text}
[Hook: A compelling question or statement]
:::

::: {.notes}
0–1 min. Let this sit for 5 seconds. Build curiosity before explaining.
:::

## [Concept Introduction]

[Brief setup - what problem are we solving?]

. . .

::: {.incremental}
- [Key point 1]
- [Key point 2]
- [Key point 3]
:::

::: {.notes}
[Timing] min. [Teaching notes - what to emphasize, common misconceptions]
:::

---

## [Key Equation or Relationship]

$$[LaTeX equation]$$

::: {.fragment}
Let's unpack each piece:

- $[symbol]$ is [description] ([units])
- $[symbol]$ is [description] ([units])
:::

::: {.fragment .highlight-red}
**The key insight:** [What this equation really tells us]
:::

::: {.notes}
Walk through slowly. This is where understanding happens.

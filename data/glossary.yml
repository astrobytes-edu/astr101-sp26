# Core Concepts
inference:
  term: "Inference"
  definition: "Drawing conclusions about quantities we cannot directly access (like a star's temperature) from quantities we can measure (like its color)."

  first_use: "Lecture 1"
  module: 1

observable:
  term: "Observable"
  definition: "A quantity that can be directly measured—brightness, position, wavelength, timing."
  context: "Astronomers have remarkably few types of observables; nearly everything else is inferred."
  first_use: "Lecture 1"
  module: 1

model:
  term: "Model"
  definition: "A mathematical relationship encoding physical assumptions that connects what we measure to what we want to know."

# Light and Radiation
photon:
  term: "Photon"
  definition: "A discrete packet of electromagnetic energy; the quantum of light."

  module: 1

wavelength:
  term: "Wavelength (λ)"

  first_use: "Lecture 1"
  module: 1

frequency:
  term: "Frequency (ν)"
  definition: "The number of wave cycles passing a point per second, measured in Hertz (Hz)."

  module: 1

spectrum:
  term: "Spectrum"
  definition: "Brightness measured as a function of wavelength—the distribution of light across different colors/energies."

  module: 1

spectroscopy:
  term: "Spectroscopy"
  definition: "The technique of spreading light into its component wavelengths to analyze composition, temperature, and motion."

# Brightness and Distance
flux:
  term: "Flux (F)"

luminosity:
  term: "Luminosity (L)"
  definition: "The total light energy emitted by a source per unit time—its intrinsic brightness."

inverse_square_law:
  term: "Inverse-square law"

ionized:
  term: "Ionized"
  definition: "An atom that has lost one or more electrons, leaving it with a net positive charge."

blackbody:
  term: "Blackbody"

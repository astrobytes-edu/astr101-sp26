kepler_period:
  predicts: "Given \\(r, M\\), it predicts the orbital period \\(P\\)."
  depends: "Scales as \\(P \\propto r^{3/2}\\) and \\(P \\propto M^{-1/2}\\)."
  says: "Farther orbits take much longer; more central mass makes orbits faster."
  assumptions:
    - "Orbit is approximately circular"
    - "Central mass dominates (two-body approximation)"
    - "Newtonian gravity"

schwarzschild_radius:
  predicts: "Given \\(M\\), it predicts the event horizon radius \\(R_{\\mathrm{sch}}\\)."
  depends: "Scales as \\(R_{\\mathrm{sch}} \\propto M\\)."
  says: "More massive objects have larger event horizons—linearly."
  assumptions:
    - "Non-rotating (Schwarzschild, not Kerr)"
    - "Uncharged"
    - "Spherically symmetric"

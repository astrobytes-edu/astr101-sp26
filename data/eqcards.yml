kepler_period:
  predicts: "Given $r, M$, it predicts the orbital period $P$."
  depends: "Scales as $P \\propto r^{3/2}$ and $P \\propto M^{-1/2}$."
  says: "Farther orbits take much longer; more central mass makes orbits faster."
  assumptions:
    - "Orbit is approximately circular"
    - "Central mass dominates (two-body approximation)"
    - "Newtonian gravity"

schwarzschild_radius:
  predicts: "Given $M$, it predicts the event horizon radius $R_{\\mathrm{sch}}$."
  depends: "Scales as $R_{\\mathrm{sch}} \\propto M$."
  says: "More massive objects have larger event horizons—linearly."
  assumptions:
    - "Non-rotating (Schwarzschild, not Kerr)"
    - "Uncharged"
    - "Spherically symmetric"

newton_gravity:
  predicts: "Given $M$, $m$, and $r$, it predicts the gravitational force $F$."
  depends: "Scales as $F \\propto Mm/r^2$."
  says: "Gravity weakens with distance squared; stronger between more massive objects."
  assumptions:
    - "Point masses or spherically symmetric"
    - "Newtonian (non-relativistic)"
    - "No other forces acting"

stefan_boltzmann:
  predicts: "Given $R$ and $T$, it predicts the luminosity $L$."
  depends: "Scales as $L \\propto R^2 T^4$."
  says: "Luminosity depends on surface area ($R^2$) and temperature ($T^4$). Double the temperature, get 16× the luminosity."
  assumptions:
    - "Blackbody radiation"
    - "Spherical, uniformly radiating surface"
    - "Effective surface temperature"

flux_luminosity_distance:
  predicts: "Given $L$ and $d$, it predicts the observed flux $F$ at the detector."
  depends: "Scales as $F \\propto L$ and $F \\propto d^{-2}$."
  says: "Apparent brightness mixes intrinsic power and distance; to infer $L$ from $F$, you must also know $d$."
  assumptions:
    - "Approximately isotropic emission (radiates equally in all directions)"
    - "Negligible absorption/scattering between source and observer"

lookback_time:
  predicts: "Given a distance $d$, it predicts the light travel time $t$ (the time between emission and detection)."
  depends: "Scales as $t \\propto d$ and $t \\propto c^{-1}$."
  says: "Light takes time to travel; looking farther away means seeing older light."
  assumptions:
    - "Light travels in a straight line at speed $c$ (simplified picture)"
    - "Ignores cosmological expansion and strong gravitational time-delay effects"

wave_relation:
  predicts: "Given any two of $c$, $\\lambda$, $\\nu$, it predicts the third."
  depends: "$\\lambda \\propto \\nu^{-1}$ (inverse relationship at fixed $c$)."
  says: "Wavelength and frequency are two ways of describing the same wave; longer wavelength means lower frequency."
  assumptions:
    - "Light travels in vacuum at speed $c$"
    - "Applies to all electromagnetic radiation"

photon_energy:
  predicts: "Given wavelength $\\lambda$ (or frequency $\\nu$), it predicts the energy $E$ of a single photon."
  depends: "$E \\propto \\nu$ and $E \\propto \\lambda^{-1}$."
  says: "Shorter wavelength = higher energy photon. The constant $h$ signals quantum mechanics is at work."
  assumptions:
    - "Light comes in discrete packets (photons)"
    - "Each photon carries energy proportional to its frequency"
    - "This is a quantum mechanical result—classical physics cannot predict it"

wien_displacement:
  predicts: "Given temperature $T$, it predicts the peak wavelength $\\lambda_{\\text{peak}}$ of thermal emission."
  depends: "$\\lambda_{\\text{peak}} \\propto T^{-1}$."
  says: "Hotter objects peak at shorter wavelengths (bluer); cooler objects peak at longer wavelengths (redder)."
  assumptions:
    - "Object radiates as a blackbody (or approximately so)"
    - "Applies to thermal (temperature-driven) radiation"

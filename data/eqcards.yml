kepler_period:
  predicts: "Given \\(r, M\\), it predicts the orbital period \\(P\\)."
  depends: "Scales as \\(P \\propto r^{3/2}\\) and \\(P \\propto M^{-1/2}\\)."
  says: "Farther orbits take much longer; more central mass makes orbits faster."
  assumptions:
    - "Orbit is approximately circular"
    - "Central mass dominates (two-body approximation)"
    - "Newtonian gravity"

schwarzschild_radius:
  predicts: "Given \\(M\\), it predicts the event horizon radius \\(R_{\\mathrm{sch}}\\)."
  depends: "Scales as \\(R_{\\mathrm{sch}} \\propto M\\)."
  says: "More massive objects have larger event horizons—linearly."
  assumptions:
    - "Non-rotating (Schwarzschild, not Kerr)"
    - "Uncharged"
    - "Spherically symmetric"

newton_gravity:
  predicts: "Given \\(M\\), \\(m\\), and \\(r\\), it predicts the gravitational force \\(F\\)."
  depends: "Scales as \\(F \\propto Mm/r^2\\)."
  says: "Gravity weakens with distance squared; stronger between more massive objects."
  assumptions:
    - "Point masses or spherically symmetric"
    - "Newtonian (non-relativistic)"
    - "No other forces acting"

stefan_boltzmann:
  predicts: "Given \\(R\\) and \\(T\\), it predicts the luminosity \\(L\\)."
  depends: "Scales as \\(L \\propto R^2 T^4\\)."
  says: "Luminosity depends on surface area (\\(R^2\\)) and temperature (\\(T^4\\)). Double the temperature, get 16× the luminosity."
  assumptions:
    - "Blackbody radiation"
    - "Spherical, uniformly radiating surface"
    - "Effective surface temperature"

flux_luminosity_distance:
  predicts: "Given \\(L\\) and \\(d\\), it predicts the observed flux \\(F\\) at the detector."
  depends: "Scales as \\(F \\propto L\\) and \\(F \\propto d^{-2}\\)."
  says: "Apparent brightness mixes intrinsic power and distance; to infer \\(L\\) from \\(F\\), you must also know \\(d\\)."
  assumptions:
    - "Approximately isotropic emission (radiates equally in all directions)"
    - "Negligible absorption/scattering between source and observer"

lookback_time:
  predicts: "Given a distance \\(d\\), it predicts the light travel time \\(t\\) (the time between emission and detection)."
  depends: "Scales as \\(t \\propto d\\) and \\(t \\propto c^{-1}\\)."
  says: "Light takes time to travel; looking farther away means seeing older light."
  assumptions:
    - "Light travels in a straight line at speed \\(c\\) (simplified picture)"
    - "Ignores cosmological expansion and strong gravitational time-delay effects"

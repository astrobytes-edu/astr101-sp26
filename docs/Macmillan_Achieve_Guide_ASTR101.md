## Part 1: Features You're Already Using

### 1. LearningCurve Adaptive Reading (10% of grade)

**What it does**: Adaptive quizzing that adjusts to each student's level, with integrated e-book access.

#### Your Planned Settings (from syllabus)
- Completion-based grading (students work until they reach the target)
- Unlimited attempts (no penalty for wrong answers)
- All chapters available throughout the semester

#### Setup Steps
1. Log in at **achieve.macmillanlearning.com**
2. Navigate to **Course Content** for your Freedman *Universe* 11th edition course
3. Select all LearningCurve activities you want available
4. Click the **Assign/Edit** (calendar icon)
5. Under **Assessment Grading Settings**:
   - Select grading type: **Completion-based**
   - Set target score (typically auto-configured)
6. Under **Dates, Points, and Gradebook Categories**:
   - Set visibility to "Available all semester" (or set your semester start/end dates)
   - Assign to the "LearningCurve" gradebook category
7. Click **Save**

#### How It Works for Students
- Questions adapt based on correct/incorrect responses
- Harder questions appear as students answer correctly
- They can see hints (reduces point value) or skip and move on
- E-book is integrated into every question—no penalty for accessing it
- After completion, students see a **Personalized Study Plan** showing areas for improvement

> **Pro tip**: Research shows students who complete 80%+ of LearningCurve activities score ~10% higher on exams.

> **New feature**: **Student Practice Mode** allows students to retake completed/past-due homework for ungraded practice before exams. You can enable this in assignment settings.

---

### 3. AI Student Tutor (Approved Tool)

**What it does**: Socratic-style 24/7 homework support that asks guiding questions rather than giving answers. Available for Astronomy courses.

**Your syllabus states**: "This Socratic-style tutor asks guiding questions to help you think through problems; it won't give you answers."

#### To Enable (if not already active)
1. Contact your Macmillan Learning representative, OR
2. In Achieve, look for **AI Tutor settings** under course configuration
3. The AI Tutor should be available for the Freedman *Universe* textbook

#### How It Works for Students
- Appears during homework when students are stuck
- Asks probing questions to help students reason through problems
- Provides instant, personalized feedback
- Does NOT give direct answers
- Available 24/7 (data shows peak usage 6 PM–3 AM)

#### Research Findings
- 52% of students reported the AI Tutor helped them organize complex problems
- Average session duration is 6.3 minutes
- Some sessions last up to 30 minutes for challenging material

> **Key point for syllabus**: You've correctly distinguished this from external AI (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) which you prohibit for graded work.

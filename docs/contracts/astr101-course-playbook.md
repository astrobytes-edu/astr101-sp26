# ASTR 101 Course-Specific Playbook

*Practical guidance for teaching intro astronomy to non-majors.*

Version: v1.0 • Status: Active • Owner: Dr. Anna Rosen

## 1. Course Identity

### What ASTR 101 Is

- **Audience:** Non-science majors fulfilling GE Physical Science (Area 5A)
- **Prerequisites:** None (assume no physics, no astronomy, variable math comfort)
- **Goal:** Scientific literacy through astronomy — how we know what we know
- **Vibe:** Accessible wonder + rigorous thinking (not "dumbed down")

### What ASTR 101 Is Not

- Not a survey of "cool space facts" without understanding
- Not a math-heavy astrophysics course (that's ASTR 201)
- Not a memorization course (understanding > recall)

### The Core Message

> **Astronomy is the art of inferring physical reality from constrained measurements.**

Every lecture should reinforce: we observe light → we build models → we test predictions.

## 2. Math Ceiling

### Explicitly In Scope

| Skill | Example | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Arithmetic | 10 × 10 = 100 | Basic operations |
| Scientific notation | 3 × 10⁸ m/s | Read, write, compare magnitudes |
| Ratios and proportions | If distance doubles, brightness is 1/4 | Core skill for scaling arguments |
| Simple algebra | Solve for one variable | Rearranging F = L / 4πd² for d |
| Squares and square roots | d² and √d | For inverse-square law |
| Powers of 10 reasoning | "10× farther = 100× dimmer" | Order-of-magnitude thinking |

### Requires Explicit Scaffolding

| Skill | How to Handle |
|-------|---------------|
| Exponents beyond squares | Show the pattern, provide worked examples |
| Logarithms | Avoid if possible; if needed, explain as "counting zeros" |
| Unit conversions | Always show the "multiply by 1" trick step-by-step |
| Graph interpretation | Label what to look for; don't assume graph literacy |

### Explicitly Out of Scope

- Calculus (no derivatives, integrals, limits)
- Trigonometry (no sin/cos/tan beyond "opposite/adjacent" if absolutely needed)
- Vector math (use "direction" and "magnitude" in words)
- Complex algebra (no simultaneous equations, no quadratics)

### The Golden Rule

> **If a student can't follow the math, they can't learn the physics.**
>
> Always provide: (1) the equation, (2) what each symbol means, (3) a worked example, (4) a sanity check.

## 3. Misconceptions Registry

### Module 1: Observing the Sky & Solar System

#### The Sky and Celestial Motion

| Misconception | Correct Model | How to Surface It |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| "Stars move across the sky because they're orbiting something" | Stars appear to move because Earth rotates | Ask: "If you stood at the North Pole, what would stars do?" |
| "The North Star is the brightest star" | Polaris is moderately bright; it's special because it's near the celestial pole | Show a star chart with magnitudes labeled |
| "Constellations are real groupings of stars" | Stars in a constellation are at vastly different distances | Show a 3D model or side-view diagram |

#### Moon and Eclipses

| Misconception | Correct Model | How to Surface It |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| "Moon phases are caused by Earth's shadow" | Phases are caused by viewing angle of the lit half | Draw the geometry; ask what shadow would look like |
| "Eclipses happen every month" | Moon's orbit is tilted ~5°, so alignment is rare | Show the orbital plane tilt |
| "The dark side of the Moon is always dark" | The far side gets as much sunlight as the near side | Clarify "dark" = "unseen from Earth" |

#### Seasons

| Misconception | Correct Model | How to Surface It |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **"Seasons are caused by Earth's distance from the Sun"** | Seasons are caused by axial tilt (23.5°) | Point out: Northern winter = perihelion (closest to Sun) |
| "The Sun is directly overhead at noon everywhere" | Only true between the tropics | Ask where students think the Sun is at noon in San Diego |

#### Gravity and Orbits

| Misconception | Correct Model | How to Surface It |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| "Objects in orbit are weightless because there's no gravity" | They're in free fall; gravity is what keeps them in orbit | Thought experiment: What if gravity turned off? |
| "Heavier objects fall faster" | All objects fall at the same rate (ignoring air resistance) | Apollo 15 hammer-feather demo video |
| "Satellites need constant thrust to stay in orbit" | Orbits are free fall; no thrust needed (except for corrections) | Ask: Why don't satellites run out of fuel? |

#### Light and Telescopes

| Misconception | Correct Model | How to Surface It |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| "Bigger telescopes magnify more" | Primary purpose is light-gathering (aperture), not magnification | Compare resolution and sensitivity |
| "We see stars as they are now" | We see light that left them years/millennia ago | Calculate: How old is the light from Proxima Centauri? |
| "Radio telescopes listen for alien signals" | Most radio astronomy studies natural emissions (not SETI) | Show examples of radio sources |

---

### Module 2: Stars & Stellar Evolution

#### The Sun

| Misconception | Correct Model | How to Surface It |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **"The Sun is on fire"** | The Sun is powered by nuclear fusion, not combustion | Ask: What would happen if the Sun were made of coal? (It would burn out in ~5000 years) |
| "The Sun is yellow" | The Sun is white; atmosphere scatters blue light | Show photo from space |
| "Solar flares cause seasons or weather" | Flares affect space weather, not Earth's climate | Distinguish space weather from weather |

#### Stellar Properties

| Misconception | Correct Model | How to Surface It |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| "Brighter stars are closer" | Brightness depends on both luminosity AND distance | Compare a nearby dim star to a distant bright one |
| "Red stars are cooler because red is 'hot'" | Counterintuitive: red = cooler, blue = hotter | Heating metal analogy (red-hot → white-hot) |
| "All stars are the same size" | Stars range from neutron stars (city-sized) to supergiants (orbit of Mars) | Size comparison graphics |
| "Star colors are due to composition" | Color is primarily determined by temperature | Show blackbody curves |

#### Stellar Evolution

| Misconception | Correct Model | How to Surface It |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| "Stars burn fuel and shrink as they age" | Main sequence stars are in hydrostatic equilibrium; they expand when they run out of core hydrogen | Explain the red giant phase |
| "The Sun will explode as a supernova" | Only stars > ~8 M☉ explode; the Sun will become a white dwarf | Mass threshold diagram |
| "Black holes suck everything in" | Black holes have normal gravity at a distance; you'd have to get very close | What if the Sun became a black hole? (Earth's orbit wouldn't change) |
| "Heavier elements come from stars" | Correct! But the mechanism matters: fusion in cores + supernovae | "We are star stuff" — Sagan |

#### Compact Objects

| Misconception | Correct Model | How to Surface It |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| "Neutron stars are made of neutrons" | Correct! But explain how electron degeneracy pressure fails | Analogy: squeezing protons and electrons together |
| "Nothing can escape a black hole" | Hawking radiation (advanced); more importantly, light can't escape from inside the event horizon | Clarify: event horizon is a boundary, not a surface |
| "Black holes are infinitely dense" | The singularity may be infinitely dense; the event horizon has finite size | Schwarzschild radius scales with mass |

---

### Module 3: Galaxies & Cosmology

#### The Milky Way

| Misconception | Correct Model | How to Surface It |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| "We can see the whole Milky Way" | We're inside it; we see a band of light from our position in the disk | Edge-on vs face-on views of other galaxies |
| "The Milky Way is the whole universe" | The Milky Way is one of hundreds of billions of galaxies | Hubble Deep Field image |

#### Galaxies and Distance

| Misconception | Correct Model | How to Surface It |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| "Galaxies are evenly distributed" | Galaxies cluster; there are voids and filaments | Large-scale structure maps |
| "Redshift means galaxies are moving away" | Cosmological redshift is space itself expanding, not motion through space | Balloon analogy (with caveats) |
| "The Big Bang happened at a point in space" | The Big Bang happened everywhere; space itself expanded | "There is no center" |

#### Cosmology

| Misconception | Correct Model | How to Surface It |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| "The universe is expanding into something" | Space itself is expanding; there's no "outside" | Hard to visualize — use analogies carefully |
| "Dark matter is regular matter we can't see" | Dark matter doesn't interact with light at all | Bullet Cluster as evidence |
| "Dark energy is pushing galaxies apart" | Dark energy accelerates expansion; it's a property of space | Distinguish from "explosion" |
| "The Big Bang was an explosion" | It was the rapid expansion of space, not an explosion into existing space | Common language problem |

## 4. Approved Analogies

### Light and Observation

| Concept | Analogy | Caveats |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Light as information | "Light is a cosmic messenger — it carries news from the stars" | Emphasize it's the *only* messenger (until gravitational waves) |
| Spectral lines | "Atomic fingerprints" | Each element has a unique pattern |
| Doppler shift | Ambulance siren pitch change | Works for motion; cosmological redshift is different (space stretching) |
| Inverse-square law | Spray paint from a can: farther away = thinner coverage | Quantify: 2× distance = 4× area = 1/4 intensity |

### Gravity and Orbits

| Concept | Analogy | Caveats |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Orbits as free fall | "The ISS is falling around Earth, not floating" | Weightlessness = falling, not absence of gravity |
| Curved spacetime | Bowling ball on a trampoline | Overused; clarify it's a 2D slice of 4D reality |
| Escape velocity | Throwing a ball upward harder and harder | At escape velocity, it never comes back |

### Stars

| Concept | Analogy | Caveats |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Hydrostatic equilibrium | "A star is a controlled explosion held together by gravity" | Balance between pressure (out) and gravity (in) |
| Stellar lifetime | "Burning the candle at both ends" — massive stars are brighter but shorter-lived | Fuel runs out faster |
| Fusion | "Squeezing hydrogen into helium releases the energy that was 'hiding' in mass" | E = mc² |
| Quantum tunneling | "Protons 'cheat' past the electric barrier" | Classical physics says fusion shouldn't happen at the Sun's core temperature |

### Cosmology

| Concept | Analogy | Caveats |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Expanding universe | Raisins in rising bread dough | All raisins move apart; no center |
| Cosmic Microwave Background | "Baby picture of the universe" | Light from 380,000 years after Big Bang |
| Dark matter | "Invisible scaffolding" that holds galaxies together | We see its gravitational effects, not light |
| Observable universe | "Our cosmic horizon" — there's more beyond, but light hasn't reached us yet | Observable ≠ total |

## 5. Vocabulary Guide

### Terms to Define Carefully

| Term | Student-Friendly Definition | Common Confusion |
|------|----------------------------|------------------|
| Luminosity | Total energy a star emits per second (intrinsic property) | Often confused with brightness |
| Brightness | How bright something appears from Earth (depends on distance) | "Apparent brightness" is the technical term |
| Light-year | Distance light travels in one year (~10 trillion km) | Not a unit of time |
| Redshift | Stretching of light to longer (redder) wavelengths | Not the same as Doppler shift for cosmology |
| Magnitude | Brightness on a logarithmic scale (lower = brighter) | Counterintuitive scale direction |

### Terms to Use Instead of Jargon

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| Flux | Brightness at Earth |
| Parsec | Light-year (or explain parsec when first used) |
| Photosphere | The Sun's visible surface |
| Spectral type | Star color/temperature class |
| Metallicity | "Heavier elements" or "elements heavier than helium" |
| Proper motion | Star's actual motion across the sky |

### Terms to Avoid Entirely (or Use with Extreme Care)

| Term | Why | Alternative |
|------|-----|-------------|
| "Empty space" | Space has quantum fields, dark energy, etc. | "Nearly empty" or "very low density" |
| "Burning" (for fusion) | Implies combustion | "Fusing" or "nuclear reactions" |
| "Proof" | Science doesn't prove; it provides evidence | "Evidence for" or "supports" |
| "Theory" (casually) | Students confuse with "guess" | "Scientific model" or "well-tested explanation" |

### Module 2: Stars & Stellar Evolution (Weeks 7-13)

**Emphasis:**
- This is YOUR expertise — lean into star formation and supernovae
- The H-R diagram is the most important tool — spend time here
- Connect stellar death to where elements come from

**Your Research Integration:**
- **Lecture on Star Formation (Mar 6):** Show your simulations
- **Lecture on High-Mass Stellar Death (Mar 23):** This is your bread and butter — go deep
- **Stellar Feedback (Apr 1):** Bridge to galaxies

**Can Skim:**
- Detailed nuclear physics (qualitative is fine)

**Key Wins:**
- If they can trace a star from birth to death, you've succeeded
- If they understand "we are star stuff," you've succeeded

### Module 3: Galaxies & Cosmology (Weeks 14-16)

**Emphasis:**
- Scale, scale, scale — help them feel how big this is
- Evidence-based reasoning: How do we know the universe is expanding?
- Dark matter and dark energy as open questions

**Can Skim:**
- Galaxy classification details (Hubble sequence overview is enough)
- AGN unified model (mention it, don't dive deep)

**Chapter 27 (Life in the Universe):**
- Taught but NOT on Module 3 exam
- Fun end-of-semester topic
- Drake equation as framework for thinking, not for calculating

**Key Wins:**
- If they understand the Big Bang is not an explosion, you've succeeded
- If they can explain one piece of dark matter evidence, you've succeeded

## 8. Common Sticking Points

### Where Students Historically Struggle

| Topic | The Sticking Point | Solution |
|-------|-------------------|----------|
| Inverse-square law | "Why is it squared?" | Area of a sphere: 4πr². Light spreads over that area. |
| Spectral line interpretation | Emission vs absorption confusion | Use the Kirchhoff's laws diagram repeatedly |
| Redshift | "Is the galaxy moving or is space expanding?" | Both happen; cosmological redshift is space expanding |
| H-R diagram | Axes are weird (luminosity up, temperature backward) | Explicitly address the axis directions every time |
| Stellar lifetimes | "Why do massive stars die faster?" | They burn fuel faster (luminosity ∝ M^3, fuel ∝ M) |
| Light travel time | "So we're seeing the past?" | Yes — and for distant objects, a very distant past |

### Questions to Expect

- "If the universe is expanding, what is it expanding into?"
- "What came before the Big Bang?"
- "Could there be life on other planets?"
- "Why can't we go faster than light?"
- "Is Pluto a planet?"

Have prepared, honest answers: "We don't know" is acceptable. "That's outside the scope of what physics can currently answer" is valid.

## Module 1: Fundamentals

## Module 2: Inferring the Properties of Stars

### How do astronomers measure stellar distances, masses, and radii using light and gravity?

Astronomers infer fundamental physical properties like distance, mass, and radius by combining three direct observations — **position on the sky, apparent brightness, and the color spectrum** — with basic physical principles.

#### **Measuring Stellar Distances**

- **Trigonometric Parallax (Gravity and Geometry):** For nearby stars, astronomers measure the annual variation in a star's apparent position caused by the Earth’s motion around the Sun. This utilizes the **Earth's orbital radius (1 AU)** as a baseline to create a triangle, where the distance $d$ in parsecs is the inverse of the parallax angle $p$ in arcseconds ($d = 1/p$).
- **Standard Candles (Light):** If a star's intrinsic **luminosity ($L$)** is known, its distance can be calculated from its measured **energy flux ($F$)**. Using the inverse-square law, distance is determined by $d = \sqrt{L / 4\pi F}$.
- **Spectroscopic Parallax:** Astronomers can estimate a star's luminosity by carefully studying its spectrum and then apply the standard candle method to find the distance.

#### **Measuring Stellar Masses**

- **Binary Star Systems (Gravity):** The primary method for measuring mass involves observing stars in **binary systems**, where two stars orbit a common center of mass.
- **Kepler's Third Law:** By measuring the **orbital period ($P$)** and the **physical separation ($a$)** of the stars, astronomers apply Newton's generalization of Kepler’s Third Law to find the total mass: $M_1 + M_2 = a^3 / P^2$ (when measured in solar masses, AU, and years).
- **Spectroscopic Binaries (Light and Doppler Shift):** If the stars are too close to resolve visually, astronomers use the **Doppler effect** to measure the radial velocity of spectral lines. The ratio of the velocity amplitudes provides the mass ratio of the two stars ($M_1/M_2 = V_2/V_1$).
- **Mass-Luminosity Scaling:** For most stars on the main sequence, observations reveal a power-law relation where **luminosity scales with mass** ($L \propto M^{3.1}$), allowing mass to be inferred from luminosity alone.

#### **Measuring Stellar Radii**

- **Stefan-Boltzmann Law (Light):** A star’s radius can be derived from its total luminosity and **surface temperature ($T$)**. According to the Stefan-Boltzmann law, $L = \sigma_{sb} T^4 4\pi R^2$. Solving for $R$ yields $R = \sqrt{L / 4\pi \sigma_{sb} T^4}$, where temperature is estimated from the star's color or peak wavelength.
- **Eclipsing Binaries (Light and Timing):** In systems where stars pass in front of each other, the duration of the eclipse provides the stars' sizes. By combining the **orbital speeds** (from Doppler shifts) with the **time intervals** between the "contacts" of the stellar rims, the individual radii ($R_1$ and $R_2$) can be calculated.
- **Angular Size (Geometry):** Though most stars appear as "points," specialized techniques like **speckle interferometry** can resolve the angular diameter of very large, nearby giant stars. If the distance ($d$) is known, the physical radius ($R$) is found using the angular size ($\alpha$) via $\alpha \approx 2R/d$.

## Module 3: Stellar Structure and Evolution

### In what ways do nuclear fusion and gravity drive stellar evolution and remnants?

The life cycles of stars and the nature of their final remains are dictated by a continuous "competition" between the inward pull of **gravity** and the outward pressure generated by **nuclear fusion** or quantum degeneracy.

#### Gravity and Star Formation

Stellar evolution begins when gravity overcomes internal pressure in a cold, dense **Giant Molecular Cloud (GMC)**. According to the **Jeans criterion**, a cloud must be sufficiently massive and cold for gravity to initiate a collapse. As the cloud contracts, gravity converts gravitational potential energy into heat, a process known as **Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction**. This continues until the core becomes hot enough (approximately 17 million Kelvin) to ignite **nuclear fusion**, establishing a stable state where gas pressure balances the inward pull of gravity.

#### **The Main Sequence: A Balanced State**

During the longest phase of a star's life, the **Main Sequence**, the star exists in a state of **hydrostatic equilibrium**. In this state:

- **Gravity** tries to pull the star's matter toward the center.
- **Nuclear fusion** in the core provides the outward pressure necessary to support the star’s weight.
- **Energy Generation**: Low-mass stars like the Sun primarily use the **proton-proton (PP) chain**, while high-mass stars rely on the **CNO cycle**, which is much more sensitive to temperature.
- **The Virial Theorem**: This physical principle dictates that the thermal energy in the interior must be comparable to the star's gravitational binding energy, linking the core's temperature directly to the star's mass and radius.

### **Post-Main-Sequence Evolution**

When a star exhausts its core hydrogen, gravity causes the inert core to contract, making it even denser and hotter. This higher temperature triggers **shell burning** in the layers surrounding the core, which generates excessive luminosity and forces the outer envelope to expand, turning the star into a **Red Giant**.

- **Low-Mass Stars**: Eventually ignite helium in a sudden "**Helium flash**" if the core is **electron degenerate**, eventually leaving behind a carbon-oxygen remnant.
- **High-Mass Stars**: Possess enough gravitational confinement to reach temperatures required to fuse heavier elements up to **Iron** (Fe). Because iron fusion requires energy rather than releasing it, the core eventually loses pressure support, leading to a catastrophic **core-collapse supernova**.

### **Stellar Remnants and Gravity's Final State**

The type of remnant left behind depends on whether gravity can be halted by quantum forces after fusion ceases:

- **White Dwarfs**: For stars with initial masses $< 8M_\odot$, gravity is balanced by **electron degeneracy pressure**. These remnants have a mass limit of **1.4 solar masses (the Chandrasekhar limit)**; exceeding this causes the remnant to collapse further.
- **Neutron Stars**: For initial masses between $8M_\odot$ and $30M_\odot$, the core collapses until it is balanced by **neutron degeneracy pressure**. They are incredibly dense, with a 10 km radius containing roughly twice the Sun's mass.
- **Black Holes**: If the remaining core mass exceeds approximately **2.1 solar masses (the TOV limit)**, gravity wins completely. The matter is crushed into a region so small that its escape speed exceeds the speed of light, creating a **black hole** defined by its **Schwarzschild radius**.

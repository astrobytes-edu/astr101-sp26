### 1) Show your work (always)

For any problem with numbers, your solution must include:

- setup (what you’re solving for)
- knowns/unknowns (what you’re given)
- equations or reasoning path (why you’re doing what you’re doing)
- units at every step (units are not decoration — they’re error-checking)
- a final answer that is clearly labeled (box/circle it)

If you only write a final number, you should **expect major point loss** even if it’s correct.

### 2) Explain your reasoning (conceptual problems)

For conceptual questions, write in complete sentences. Aim for:

- Claim: your answer
- Evidence/Reasoning: why (use the lecture ideas)
- Optional sketch: a quick diagram is often worth 10 sentences

### 3) Use diagrams like a scientist

For geometry/sky problems: draw a labeled sketch (Sun–Earth–observer, horizon/zenith, tilt, angles). You don’t need to be an artist — just be clear.

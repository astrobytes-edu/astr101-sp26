## Weekly Homework + Grade Memos (15%)

Homework builds quantitative fluency and model-based reasoning. Expect multi-step problems and conceptual questions where units, assumptions, and physical interpretation matter as much as the final number. The purpose of homework is exam preparation and skill-building through consistent, high-quality practice — not busy work.

### Submission workflow (two-stage)

**Homework Solutions — due Monday 11:59 pm PT (Canvas)**

- Must be uploaded as **one single, readable PDF** (not a photo dump).
- Organize clearly. Show your work. Label final answers.
- **No late submissions.** Instructor solutions will be posted Tuesday morning, so late work cannot be accepted.
- **Lowest homework score will be dropped** (to cover one off-week or emergency).

**Self-Assessment + Reflection (“Grade Memo”) — due Wednesday 11:59 pm PT (Canvas)**

- Self-assess (self-grade) your work using the homework rubric (posted on Canvas) and the posted solutions/guidance.
- Submit a brief grade memo that includes:
  - what you got right (and why),
  - what broke (and where),
  - what you learned,
  - what you will do differently next time.
- Your grade memo must also include:
  - a per-problem self-rating (1–5) with brief justification, and
  - AI and collaboration disclosure (even if “none”).
- Vague memos (e.g., “I need to study more”) will not earn full credit unless they include a specific error diagnosis and a concrete next-step habit.

### How your homework is graded (Instructor 0–5 score)

I evaluate your combined submission (Monday solutions + Wednesday grade memo) and assign an overall score from 0–5. Homework is graded primarily on completion, professionalism, and learning behaviors, not just final correctness. “Professionalism” here means your work is readable, logically organized, shows steps and units, and reflects honest effort. Your grade memo is graded on the quality of your self-assessment, reflection, and evidence of growth.

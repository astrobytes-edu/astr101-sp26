## Why this module matters

We've studied individual stars, but stars are just building blocks. In this
final module, we zoom out to understand the Milky Way, external galaxies,
and the universe as a whole. We'll see how observations of galaxy motions
led to the discovery of dark matter, and how the expansion of space itself
tells us about cosmic history.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Describe the structure of the Milky Way and evidence for dark matter
- Explain the Hubble law and cosmic expansion
- Interpret the cosmic microwave background
- Connect stellar evolution to galactic chemical enrichment

- **What is dark matter?** It makes up ~27% of the universe. We've never detected a dark matter particle directly.
- **Why is there more matter than antimatter?** The Big Bang should have made equal amounts — where did the antimatter go?
- **What happened before the Big Bang?** Our physics breaks down at t = 0.
- **Is the Hubble tension real?** Local and CMB measurements of H₀ disagree by ~5σ. Systematic error or new physics?
- **Why do galaxies spin faster than expected?** Dark matter or modified gravity (MOND)?

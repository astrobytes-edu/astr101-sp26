The Big Dipper looks like a family.
:::

::: {.fragment .mt-2}
But these stars aren't neighbors in space.

They range from **79 to 124 light-years** away.
:::
:::
::::

::: {.fragment .mt-2 .text-muted}
The pattern exists only because they lie along similar **directions** from Earth.
:::

::: {.notes}
0–2 min. Let the image speak first.

"When you look at the Big Dipper, your brain sees a pattern—a group. But space is 3D, and you're seeing a 2D projection. These stars just happen to be in the same general direction."

## Today's Learning Objectives {background-image="/assets/images/common/noirlab-nightsky-mosaic.jpg" background-opacity="0.2"}

::: {.bg-muted .p-2}

By the end of today, you'll be able to:

::: {.incremental .text-sm}
- Explain why the sky is a map of **directions**, not distances
- Use the **celestial sphere** to locate objects: horizon, zenith, poles, equator, ecliptic
- Explain seasons as **axial tilt** (sun angle + day length), not changing distance
- Interpret **solstices and equinoxes** geometrically
- Use **angular size** reasoning to compare sizes and distances
:::

:::

::: {.notes}
2–3 min. Frame the day: "Today is about geometry. If you can draw it, you can understand it."

The Celestial Sphere
:::

*A Map of Directions*

::: {.notes}
3 min. Section transition. Brief pause.
:::

## The Problem: No Depth Perception {background-image="/assets/images/common/noirlab-nightsky-mosaic.jpg" background-opacity="0.3"}

::: {.text-center .text-base .text-muted}
Look up at the night sky. You see points of light scattered across a dark dome.
:::

::: {.fragment .text-center .mt-4}
**Here's the fundamental problem:**

Your eyes can't tell you whether a star is<br> **close and dim** or **far and luminous**.
:::

::: {.fragment .text-center .mt-2 .text-muted}
The sky gives us *directions* by default.<br> Measuring *distances* requires extra work.
:::

::: {.notes}
3–4 min. "This isn't a limitation—it's a starting point. We embrace what the sky naturally gives us: a coordinate system for pointing at things."
:::

---

## The Celestial Sphere

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
{{< img celestial-sphere-directions width="100%" >}}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Imagine standing at the center of a vast, transparent globe.

::: {.fragment}
Every star, planet, and galaxy can be located by **pointing** in some direction.
:::

:::
::::

::: {.fragment .mt-2 .bg-muted .p-2}
**Key insight:** The celestial sphere doesn't represent where things *are* — it represents where to *look*.
:::

::: {.notes}
4–5 min. "It's a direction-finder, not a distance-finder. Objects at wildly different distances get mapped to the same sphere."
:::

---

## Reference Points on the Sky

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}
{{< img celestial-sphere-reference-points width="100%" >}}
:::

::: {.column width="45%" .text-sm}
| Point | What It Is |
|-------|------------|
| **Zenith** | Straight up from where you stand |
| **Celestial poles** | Earth's rotation axis extended to the sky |

::: {.fragment .mt-2 .text-sm .text-muted}
**Zenith** is your local "up."

**North** is a compass direction along the horizon — not the same as zenith!
:::
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
5–6 min. Common confusion: students mix up "zenith" and "north." Emphasize: zenith is straight up, north is along the horizon.
:::

---

## Reference Circles on the Sky

:::{.text-sm}
| Circle | Definition | What It Corresponds To |
|--------|------------|----------------------|
| **Celestial equator** | Earth's equator projected onto the sky | Divides N/S celestial hemispheres |
| **Horizon** | Where sky meets ground | Your local view (depends on location) |
| **Ecliptic** | Sun's yearly path across the sky | Earth's orbital plane projected onto sky |
:::

::: {.fragment .mt-2 .bg-muted .p-2 .text-sm}
All three are **great circles** — they divide the celestial sphere into equal halves.
:::

::: {.notes}
6–7 min. "These aren't arbitrary—they're defined by Earth's rotation (equator) and orbit (ecliptic)."
:::

---

## Celestial Coordinates

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%" .text-xs}

| Coordinate | Meaning | Earth Analog |
|------------|---------------|----------|
| **Declination (Dec)** | Angle N/S of celestial equator (−90° to +90°) | Latitude |
| **Right Ascension (RA)** | Position along equator (0–24h) | Longitude |

::: {.fragment .mt-2 .text-base}
**Why hours for RA?**

24 hours = 360°, so 1 hour = 15°.

The sky appears to rotate once per day — hours match the clock.
:::

:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
::: {.bg-muted .p-2}
**Observable:** Position on the sky (RA, Dec)

**Model:** Celestial sphere geometry

**Inference:** Where to point the telescope tonight
:::
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
7–8 min. Don't dwell on RA details—just establish the analogy to lat/long.
:::

---

## Two Circles That Matter

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="45%"}
{{< img celestial-sphere-ecliptic width="100%" >}}
:::

::: {.column width="55%" .text-sm}
**Celestial Equator:** Defined by Earth's *rotation* — perpendicular to the spin axis.<br>

**Ecliptic:** Defined by Earth's *orbit* — the Sun's apparent yearly path.

:::
::::

::: {.fragment .mt-2 .bg-muted .p-2 .text-sm}
**The crucial point:** These circles are tilted **23.5°** relative to each other.

This tilt is why we have **seasons**.
:::

::: {.notes}
8–9 min. "Two different motions—rotation and orbit—define two different reference planes. They don't align, and that misalignment changes everything."
:::

---

## Two Motions, Two Time Scales

| Motion | Cause | Time Scale | What You See |
|--------|-------|------------|--------------|
| **Daily arc** | Earth's rotation | 24 hours | Sun rises east, sets west |
| **Yearly drift** | Earth's orbit | 365 days | Sun slides eastward along ecliptic |

::: {.fragment .mt-2 .text-muted .text-sm}
The daily arc is why the Sun is up during the day.

The yearly drift is why the Sun's noon altitude changes with the seasons.
:::

::: {.notes}
9–10 min. "When we talk about the Sun's position 'changing with seasons,' we mean along the ecliptic—the yearly drift, not the daily motion."
:::

---

## Quick Check: The Ecliptic {background-color="#1a1a2e"}

::: {.quiz}
The ecliptic is:

- [ ] The path the Moon takes across the sky each night
- [ ] The Sun's apparent path across the sky over the course of a year
- [ ] The same as the celestial equator
- [ ] The edge of Earth's shadow
:::

::: {.notes}
10–11 min. Give 30 seconds.

Correct: B. The ecliptic traces Earth's orbital plane—the Sun appears to move along it over a year.
:::

Seasons: Tilt, Not Distance

*The Misconception That Won't Die*

::: {.notes}
11 min. Section transition. "Now we apply the geometry."
:::

---

## The Common Misconception {background-color="black"}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}
{{< img seasons-misconception-distance width="100%" >}}
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
::: {.text-lg}
"Earth is closer to the Sun in summer."
:::

::: {.fragment .mt-2}
This is **wrong** — but it's a reasonable first guess.
:::

::: {.fragment .mt-2 .text-muted}
Surveys show many college students and adults believe this.
:::
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
11–12 min. Don't shame—acknowledge it's intuitive. "It makes sense! Closer = warmer, right? But nature doesn't cooperate."
:::

---

## The Proof: Opposite Hemispheres

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.bg-muted .p-2}
**If distance caused seasons:**

Both hemispheres would have summer at the same time — when Earth is closest to the Sun.
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.fragment .bg-muted .p-2}
**What we observe:**

When it's summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it's **winter** in the Southern Hemisphere.

The hemispheres have **opposite** seasons.
:::
:::
::::

::: {.fragment .mt-2 .text-center}
**Conclusion:** Distance cannot be the cause.
:::

::: {.notes}
12–13 min. "This is the killer observation. One fact rules out the entire hypothesis."
:::

---

## The Numbers Don't Work Either

::: {.incremental}
- Earth's distance from the Sun varies by only **~3%** over the year
- **Perihelion** (closest): 147 million km — in **January**
- **Aphelion** (farthest): 152 million km — in **July**
- This 3% distance change affects solar flux by only **~7%**
:::

::: {.fragment .mt-2 .bg-muted .p-2}
**The irony:** Earth is *farthest* from the Sun during Northern Hemisphere summer!
:::

::: {.notes}
13–14 min. "The effect is too small AND in the wrong direction for the Northern Hemisphere."
:::

---

## The Real Mechanism: Effect 1

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}
{{< img seasons-effect1-sunlight-angle width="100%" >}}
:::

::: {.column width="45%" .text-sm}
**Sunlight Angle**

When the Sun is higher in the sky, its rays hit the ground more **directly**.

::: {.fragment .mt-2}
**Flashlight analogy:**

- Straight down → bright circle
- Tilted → same light spreads over larger area
- Less energy per square meter
:::
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
14–15 min. "Effect 1: sun angle. Higher sun = more concentrated energy."
:::

---

## The Real Mechanism: Effect 2

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}
{{< img seasons-effect2-sun-path width="100%" >}}
:::

::: {.column width="45%" .text-sm}
**Day Length**

When your hemisphere tilts toward the Sun, the Sun takes a **longer path** across your sky.<br>

::: {.fragment .mt-2 .text-sm}
<br>**San Diego (~32°N):**

| Season | Day Length | Noon Altitude |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| Summer solstice | ~14 hours | ~81° |
| Winter solstice | ~10 hours | ~35° |
:::
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
15–16 min. "Effect 2: day length. More hours of heating. The combination is powerful—4 extra hours of more direct sunlight."
:::

---

## The Bottom Line

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}
{{< img seasons-geometry-illumination width="100%" >}}
:::

::: {.column width="45%" .text-sm}
::: {.bg-muted .p-2}
**Observable:** Sun's noon altitude and day length change through the year

**Model:** Earth's 23.5° axial tilt

**Inference:** Seasons are about *solar energy per square meter per day*
:::

:::
::::

::: {.fragment .mt-0 .text-sm .text-center}
**Tilt changes this through:**

1. **Sun angle** (how concentrated)
2. **Day length** (how many hours)
:::

::: {.notes}
16–17 min. "This is the complete answer. Tilt creates two geometric effects that combine to make seasons."
:::

---

## Quick Check: Summer Sun Path {background-color="#1a1a2e"}

::: {.quiz}
During summer in your hemisphere, the Sun:

- [ ] Is closer to Earth and appears larger
- [ ] Rises and sets at the same points as in winter, just brighter
- [ ] Takes a higher, longer path across the sky
- [ ] Moves faster across the sky
:::

::: {.notes}
17–18 min. Give 30 seconds.

Correct: C. Higher path (more direct energy) + longer path (more hours of heating).
:::

---

## Solstices and Equinoxes

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}
{{< img earth-orbit-seasons width="95%" >}}

::: {.text-sm .text-muted .mt-2}
**Equinox** = day ≈ night everywhere

**Solstice** = Sun "stands still" at extreme
:::
:::

::: {.column width="45%" .text-xs}
| Event | Date | What Happens |
|-------|------|--------------|
| **March Equinox** | ~Mar 20 | Sun crosses equator going north |
| **June Solstice** | ~Jun 21 | Sun farthest north; longest NH day |
| **Sept Equinox** | ~Sep 22 | Sun crosses equator going south |
| **Dec Solstice** | ~Dec 21 | Sun farthest south; shortest NH day |

:::
::::

::: {.notes}
18–19 min. "Four special geometry days. The ecliptic and equator intersect at equinoxes; the Sun reaches its extremes at solstices."
:::

---

## Demo: Seasons Explorer

::: {.bg-muted .p-2 .text-center}
**Open:** [astrobytes-edu.github.io/astr101-sp26/demos/seasons/](https://astrobytes-edu.github.io/astr101-sp26/demos/seasons/)
:::

::: {.incremental .mt-2}
**Demo Mission 1: Test the Distance Hypothesis**

- Click through the 4 season presets
- Record the **Earth-Sun Distance** for each
- Is Earth closer during NH summer or winter?
:::

::: {.fragment .mt-2 .text-muted .text-sm}
(You should find Earth is *farthest* from the Sun in July—the opposite of what distance hypothesis predicts!)
:::

::: {.notes}
19–21 min. Have students follow along on their devices if possible. This is active learning.
:::

---

## Demo Mission 2: The Real Mechanism

::: {.bg-muted .p-2}
**With display overlays on:**

- Go to **June Solstice** vs **December Solstice**
- Record **Day Length** and **Sun Altitude** for both
:::

| Season | Day Length | Sun Altitude |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| June Solstice | _____ | _____ |
| December Solstice | _____ | _____ |

::: {.fragment .mt-2}
**Key question:** What changes between June and December that explains the temperature difference?
:::

::: {.notes}
21–23 min. "Day length and sun altitude both change dramatically. Distance barely changes. Case closed."
:::

*How Big Things **Look***

::: {.notes}

:::

---

## The Fundamental Insight

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}
{{< img angular-size-tradeoff width="100%" >}}
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
How big is the Moon?

::: {.fragment .text-sm}
In kilometers: **3,474 km** diameter.

But that's not what you *see*.
:::

::: {.fragment .mt-2 .text-sm}
What you see is how much of your field of view it occupies — its **angular size**.

The Moon's angular size: **~0.5°**
:::
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
23–24 min. "Angular size is the angle an object subtends. It depends on both physical size AND distance."
:::

---

## Angular Units

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%" .text-sm}

| Unit | Relation | Example |
|--------|----------|---------|
| 1 degree (°) | Base unit | Thumb width at arm's length ≈ 2° |
| 1 arcminute (') | 1° = 60' | Human eye resolution ≈ 1' |
| 1 arcsecond (") | 1' = 60" | Telescope territory |

::: {.fragment .mt-2 .text-sm}
**Useful conversion:**

0.5° = 30' = 1800"
:::

:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
{{< img unit-circle-radians width="100%" >}}

::: {.text-sm .text-muted}
A radian is defined by $θ =$ arc/radius.

1 radian ≈ 57.3°
:::
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
24–25 min. "Degrees for big stuff, arcminutes and arcseconds for small stuff. Astronomers use arcseconds for tiny angles."
:::

---

## The Small-Angle Formula

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%" .bg-muted .p-2 .text-sm}
For small angles (less than a few degrees):

$$\boxed{\theta = \frac{D}{d} \quad \text{(radians)}}$$

To convert to degrees:

$$\boxed{\theta_{\text{degrees}} = 57.3° \times \frac{D}{d}}$$

where $D$ = physical diameter, $d$ = distance
:::

::: {.column width="36%" .text-sm}
::: {.fragment}
**Key insight:** Angular size depends on **both** physical size **and** distance.

A large object far away can look the same as a small object nearby.
:::
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
25–26 min. "This formula is the heart of angular size reasoning. Size divided by distance."
:::

---

## Worked Example: The Moon

::: {.incremental}
- Moon's diameter: $D = 3474$ km
- Moon's distance: $d = 384{,}000$ km
- Angular size: $\theta = 57.3° \times \frac{3474 \text{ km}}{384{,}000 \text{ km}} = 57.3° \times 0.00905$
- **Result: θ ≈ 0.52°** (about half a degree)
:::

::: {.fragment .mt-2 .text-muted}
That's roughly half the width of your pinky finger at arm's length.
:::

::: {.notes}
26–27 min. Walk through the calculation. "The formula works—and it matches what we see."
:::

---

## The Sun-Moon Coincidence {background-color="black"}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**The Sun:**

- Diameter: ~1,400,000 km
- Distance: ~150,000,000 km
- Angular size: **~0.53°**
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**The Moon:**

- Diameter: ~3,474 km
- Distance: ~384,000 km
- Angular size: **~0.52°**
:::
::::

::: {.fragment .mt-2 .text-center .text-lg}
The Sun is **400× larger** but also **400× farther**.

The factors cancel — they appear **almost exactly the same size**!
:::

::: {.notes}
27–28 min. "This is a cosmic coincidence. No law of physics requires this—it's just where we happen to be in history."
:::

---

## Why This Matters {background-image="/assets/images/module-01/lec04/total-solar-eclipse.webp" background-opacity="0.6"}

::: {.text-center .text-xl .font-semibold}
Because of this coincidence, the Moon can *just barely* cover the Sun completely.
:::

::: {.fragment .text-center .mt-4}
**Total solar eclipses** are possible.

We see the Sun's corona—its outer atmosphere—only during these moments.
:::

::: {.notes}
28–29 min. "If the Moon were smaller or farther, we'd never see totality. This coincidence is why eclipses are so spectacular."
:::

---

## Quick Check: Same Angular Size {background-color="#1a1a2e"}

::: {.quiz}
Two planets have the same angular size as seen from Earth. This means:

- [ ] They have the same physical diameter
- [ ] They are at the same distance
- [ ] The ratio of their diameters equals the ratio of their distances
- [ ] They have the same luminosity
:::

::: {.notes}
29–30 min. Give 30 seconds.

Correct: C. Same angular size means the size-to-distance ratio is the same.
:::

---

## Demo: Angular Size Explorer

::: {.bg-muted .p-2 .text-center .text-sm}
**Open:** [astrobytes-edu.github.io/astr101-sp26/demos/angular-size/](https://astrobytes-edu.github.io/astr101-sp26/demos/angular-size/)
:::

::: {.incremental .mt-2 .text-sm}
**Explore:**

- Double the distance → what happens to angular size?
- Double the physical size → what happens to angular size?
- Compare Sun vs Moon (Today) presets
- Watch the unit label (° / ′ / ″) when angles are tiny
:::

::: {.fragment .mt-2 .text-muted .text-sm}
You should find: distance ×2 → angular size ÷2 (inverse relationship)
:::

::: {.notes}
30–32 min. Quick hands-on demo. "Verify the formula with your own eyes."
:::

---

## A Cosmic Privilege

::: {.incremental}
- The Moon is drifting away from Earth at **3.8 cm per year**
- We measure this with **laser retroreflectors** left by Apollo astronauts
- Billions of years ago, the Moon appeared **much larger**
- In ~600 million years, the Moon will appear **too small** to fully cover the Sun
:::

::: {.fragment .mt-2 .bg-muted .p-2}
We live in a **privileged cosmic moment**: the only era when total solar eclipses are possible.
:::

::: {.notes}
32–33 min. "In the past, annular eclipses weren't possible because the Moon was too big. In the future, total eclipses won't be possible because the Moon will be too small. *We're lucky.*"
:::

::: {.notes}
33 min. Section transition to wrap-up.
:::

---

## The Through-Line: Geometry

::: {.incremental}
- **Celestial sphere:** The geometry of *directions* in the sky
- **Seasons:** The geometry of *illumination* from Earth's tilt
- **Angular size:** The geometry of *apparent size* from distance
:::

::: {.fragment .mt-2 .bg-muted .p-2}
**Observable:** Positions, angles, apparent sizes

**Model:** 3D geometry of Earth, Sun, Moon, stars

**Inference:** Real physical properties and motions
:::

::: {.notes}
33–34 min. "All of today's concepts are geometry. If you can draw it, you can understand it."
:::

---

## Looking Ahead: Lecture 4

::: {.bg-muted .p-2}
**Next time:** Moon Phases and Eclipses

We'll apply angular size to understand:

::: {.incremental}
- Why the Moon appears to change shape each month
- Why eclipses don't happen every month
- The difference between total, annular, and partial eclipses
:::
:::

::: {.fragment .mt-2 .text-muted}
**Preview:** Moon phases are NOT caused by Earth's shadow. (The geometry will prove it.)
:::

::: {.notes}
34–35 min. "Everything you learned today—celestial sphere, angular size—comes back in Lecture 4."
:::

---

## Takeaways {background-image="/assets/images/common/noirlab-nightsky-mosaic.jpg" background-opacity="0.2"}

::: {.bg-muted .p-2 .text-sm}
**What to recognize:**

::: {.incremental}
1. The sky is a map of **directions**, not distances—that's the celestial sphere
2. Seasons are caused by **axial tilt** (sun angle + day length), not distance
3. **Angular size** depends on both physical size AND distance
4. The Sun-Moon angular size match is a **coincidence** that enables total eclipses
:::
:::

::: {.fragment .mt-2 .text-center .text-muted}
*Recognition, not retention — you should be able to identify these ideas when they return.*
:::

::: {.notes}
35–37 min. "You don't need to memorize formulas. You need to recognize these patterns when you see them."
:::

## Reading & Practice

::: {.bg-muted .p-2}
**Before next class:**

- Complete the **Lecture 3 Reading** (includes demo explorations)
- Work through the **Check Yourself** questions (*some will be assigned for homework*)
- Try at least 3 **Practice Problems**
- Read or skim the **Lecture 4 Reading** 
:::

::: {.fragment .mt-2}
**Questions?**

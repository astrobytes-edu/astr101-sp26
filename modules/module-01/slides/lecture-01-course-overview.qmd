**Instructor note (structure):** This deck is written for a 75‑minute meeting. For a 50‑minute version, skip the “Course Philosophy & Roadmap” block and shorten the TPS activities.

**Reveal speaker notes:** Press **S** during presentation to open speaker view. Notes blocks are written using `::: {.notes}` as documented in Quarto’s Reveal guide.

## Today’s puzzle

**We can never visit most objects we study.**  
So… how do we know anything at all?

- What we *measure* (observables)
- What we *infer* (physical reality)
- Why physics + math are the bridge

::: {.notes}
0–2 min. Set tone: awe + intellectual honesty.

Key line: “Astronomy is inference under extreme constraints.”
:::

## {data-background-image="../images/jwst-deepfield.jpg" data-background-size="cover"}

::: {.notes}
**Hook image:** JWST First Deep Field (SMACS 0723) or Hubble eXtreme Deep Field.

**Prep:** Download a high-res public-domain/press-release image and save as `images/jwst-deepfield.jpg`.

**Delivery:** Put it full screen. Say nothing for ~10 seconds.

Alt text for accessibility (not visible on slide): Deep space image showing thousands of galaxies of varying sizes and colors, including lensing arcs.

## The “impossible task”

We can’t:

- go there
- touch it
- run controlled experiments on it

We *can*:

- collect photons
- measure patterns in those photons
- use physics to reconstruct a story

::: {.notes}
2–5 min. Script (tight):

“Every dot and smudge is a galaxy. Some of that light has traveled ~13 billion years. We will never visit these objects. All we have is the light that reaches us. And yet we infer temperatures, compositions, motions, even histories. How?”

Transition: “First: what do we actually measure?”
:::

---

## Quick poll (anonymous)

What feels *hardest* about studying objects we can’t visit?

A. We can’t see them clearly enough  
B. We don’t know how far away they are  
C. We can only detect light—nothing else  
D. The physics is too complicated  
E. All of the above

::: {.notes}
5–8 min. Validate multiple answers.

Bridge lines:
- A → resolution limits are real; we get clever.
- B → distance is foundational; Week 2.
- C → the deep truth: light is both curse + gift.
- D → physics is elegant once you learn its “compression.”
:::

---

## Stars are (mostly) points of light

Even huge telescopes usually **cannot resolve** a star’s disk.

So we live with the “point-source problem.”

::: {.notes}
8–12 min.

Explain angular resolution qualitatively. Optional analogy:

“The nearest star system is ~270,000× farther than the Sun. If the Sun were that far, it would look ~270,000× smaller—essentially a point.”
:::

---

## The three observables

For nearly all stars, we directly measure only:

1. **Position** (and changes with time)
2. **Apparent brightness** (flux)
3. **Spectrum** (brightness vs wavelength)

::: {.notes}
12–13 min. This is the anchor slide for the course.

Instructor tip: pause after each item. Make them say it back.
:::

---

## Observable 1: Position

- where the star is on the sky
- how it drifts (proper motion)
- tiny annual wobble (parallax)

::: {.notes}
13–15 min.

Key message: parallax is geometry → distance.

Don’t go deep yet; tease Week 2.
:::

---

## Observable 2: Apparent brightness

What the detector measures:

- energy per area per time reaching Earth

But brightness depends on:

- intrinsic power output
- distance

::: {.notes}
15–17 min.

Line to plant now: “apparent ≠ intrinsic.”

Optional: mention historical magnitudes as a fun aside.
:::

---

## Observable 3: Spectrum

Starlight spread into wavelength:

- overall shape (“color”)
- absorption/emission lines
- shifts and broadenings

::: {.notes}
17–18 min.

Promise: spectrum is where the universe hides its receipts.
:::

---

## Think–Pair–Share 1

From only **position, brightness, spectrum**, what physical properties might we infer?

- **Think** (30 s)
- **Pair** (60 s)
- **Share** (2 min)

::: {.notes}
18–20 min.

Collect guesses without correcting yet. Write them down.

Expected: distance, temperature, composition, size, motion, mass, age.
Transition: “Let’s see the full ladder.”
:::

---

## The inference ladder

From 3 observables → many physical properties.

Examples:

- **Distance** (geometry)
- **Luminosity** (brightness + distance)
- **Temperature** (spectral shape)
- **Composition** (lines)
- **Velocity** (Doppler)
- **Radius** (luminosity + temperature)
- **Age** (models + multiple steps)

::: {.notes}
20–25 min.

You can optionally show a ladder graphic here (instructor-created). If you add one, store as `images/inference-ladder.png` and include it on this slide.

Key message: “Some inferences are one step. Others are a staircase.”
:::

---

## Think–Pair–Share 2

Why is **distance** relatively “easy,” but **age** is hard?

- **Think** (30 s)
- **Pair** (90 s)

::: {.notes}
25–30 min.

Reveal:
- Distance: geometry (angle + baseline).
- Age: not directly visible; requires mass, luminosity, temperature, composition + an evolutionary model.

Core idea: chain length → uncertainty.
:::

---

## Astronomy is forensics

A detective can’t rewind time.

They reconstruct a story from evidence.

We do the same—using **physics** as our toolkit.

::: {.notes}
30–35 min.

Make it vivid but not cheesy:

“Light is our fingerprint powder.”

Bridge: “Here’s the single equation that captures the core ambiguity.”
:::

---

## The central relationship

$$F = \frac{L}{4\pi d^2}$$

- $F$ = **flux** (what we measure)
- $L$ = **luminosity** (what we want)
- $d$ = **distance** (what we must infer)

::: {.notes}
35–42 min.

Interpret physically:
- Same $L$, farther → dimmer.
- Double $d$ → $F$ drops by 4.

If you want a graphic: add an inverse-square diagram to `images/inverse-square.png` and place it on next slide.
:::

---

## Inverse-square intuition

Same total light… bigger sphere.

- area $\propto d^2$
- so flux $\propto 1/d^2$

::: {.notes}
Show diagram if available: `![](../images/inverse-square.png)`.

If no diagram: do a quick “sphere surface area” gesture.
:::

---

## Think–Pair–Share 3 (the ambiguity)

Two stars have the **same apparent brightness**.

- Star A: $d=10$ pc
- Star B: $d=100$ pc

Which has higher **luminosity**? By what factor?

::: {.notes}
42–47 min.

Expected: $L_B/L_A = (100/10)^2 = 100$.

Key message: “Nearby & dim” can look identical to “far & brilliant.”

Set up next lecture: we need comfort with powers of ten and ratios.
:::

---

## Why we do “Math Boot Camp”

Astronomy uses numbers that are… ridiculous.

Scientific notation and units are not busywork.

They are **navigation tools**.

::: {.notes}
47–50 min.

Tone: reassuring, not threatening.

Promise: “By the end of Thursday, you’ll be able to do the ‘how many times bigger/farther’ questions confidently.”
:::

---

## Course philosophy

This course rewards:

- **process** (show your reasoning)
- **growth** (iteration over time)
- **productive struggle** (mistakes = data)

::: {.notes}
50–55 min.

Keep it grounded: “Science is not a performance; it’s a method.”

If you have specific policy language you want, we can embed it in `course/policies.qmd` and link.
:::

---

## Roadmap (bird’s-eye)

We’re building an inference engine, layer by layer:

1. **Measurements & stellar properties**
2. **Stellar evolution**
3. **Star formation & the ISM**
4. **Galaxies**
5. **Cosmology**

::: {.notes}
55–62 min.

Tell the story: “zoom out” arc.

Avoid promising exact week ranges unless your schedule is finalized.
:::

---

## Concept check

Which is **directly observable** for a distant star?

A. Mass  
B. Age  
C. Apparent brightness  
D. Luminosity  
E. Distance

::: {.notes}
62–67 min.

Answer: C.

Debrief: observable vs inferred.
:::

---

## The one thing

**Astronomers are inference engines.**

We take limited data—position, brightness, spectrum—  
and use physics to reconstruct reality.

::: {.notes}
67–70 min.

Land the plane. Slow down.

One-sentence closer: “The math is not the obstacle; it’s the microscope.”
:::

---

## Thursday: Math Boot Camp

We’ll practice:

- scientific notation
- orders of magnitude
- dimensional analysis
- ratio reasoning
- unit conversions (SI / CGS / astro units)

::: {.notes}
70–75 min.

Optional prep link for scale intuition (verbal only): “Powers of ten” interactive.

End with logistics + questions.
:::

---

## Questions?

::: {.notes}
Leave space. Invite questions about course structure *and* the big picture.

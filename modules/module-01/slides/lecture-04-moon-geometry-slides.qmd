## {background-color="black"}

::: {.text-center .text-xl .font-semibold .mb-2}
Two questions that secretly have the same answer:
:::

::: {.fragment .text-center .text-lg .text-muted}
Why does the Moon change shape?
:::

::: {.fragment .text-center .text-lg .text-muted}
Why don’t we get eclipses every month?
:::

::: {.fragment .text-center .mt-4}
Geometry. (Not vibes.)
:::

::: {.notes}
0–1 min. Hook. Emphasize: "Today is a geometry day. If you can draw it, you can predict it."
:::

---

## Today's Learning Objectives {background-image="/assets/images/common/noirlab-nightsky-mosaic.jpg" background-opacity="0.2"}

::: {.bg-muted .p-2 .text-sm}
By the end of today, you'll be able to:

::: {.incremental}
- Explain Moon phases as changing viewing geometry of the Moon’s sunlit half (not Earth’s shadow)
- Predict the Moon’s phase from Sun–Earth–Moon geometry and describe when each phase is visible
- Distinguish phases from eclipses and explain why eclipses do not happen every month
- Define nodes and explain eclipse seasons as repeated alignment windows
- Connect angular size to eclipse type (total vs. annular) using geometric reasoning
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
1–2 min. Point out: phases (common), eclipses (rare) — same ingredients, different alignments.
:::

---

## Quick Break (2–3 min): NotebookLM {background-image="/assets/images/common/noirlab-nightsky-mosaic.jpg" background-opacity="0.2"}

::: {.bg-muted .p-2 .text-sm}
Open NotebookLM: [notebooklm.google.com](https://notebooklm.google.com/)

:::: {.columns .mt-2}
::: {.column width="52%"}
::: {.bg-muted .p-2 .text-xs}
**Make your notebook (now):**

1. Create a new notebook: **Lecture 4 — Moon Geometry**
2. Add sources by pasting the **lecture reading web pages** (URLs)
3. Ask it to generate retrieval questions + “find-it-fast” summaries

Example source URL to add:
`{{< meta params.website-url >}}/modules/module-01/readings/lecture-04-moon-geometry-reading.html`
:::
:::

::: {.column width="48%"}
::: {.bg-muted .p-2 .text-xs}
**Why NotebookLM:**

::: {.incremental}
- It’s **grounded in your sources** (it answers from what you add)
- It can **cite where it got the answer** (use the citations to verify)
- It’s great for **retrieval practice** (quiz yourself fast)
- It can produce **multimodal study outputs** (feature-dependent): audio overview (“podcast”), study guide, concept map, slide-style summary
:::
:::

:::
::::
:::

::: {.mt-2 .text-xs .text-muted}
**Caveats:** Study tool only. Don’t use it to generate graded solutions. If it doesn’t cite the reading, treat it as untrusted and go back to the source.
:::

::: {.notes}
Do this as a real break + micro-demo (2–3 min max).

Framing:
- NotebookLM is for studying and review; it should not write graded solutions.
- If students have the course NotebookLM, open it from the posted invite/link (Canvas/website).

Two demo prompts:
- "Make 8 retrieval questions on Moon phases + eclipses. Include 2 misconception checks."
- "Where in the reading do we explain why eclipses aren’t monthly? Summarize in 3 bullets."

## Quick Quiz: What Causes Phases? {background-color="#1a1a2e"}

::: {.quiz}
Moon phases are caused by:

- [ ] Earth’s shadow falling on the Moon
- [ ] The Moon passing through different parts of Earth’s atmosphere
- [ ] The geometry of viewing the Moon’s lit half from different angles
- [ ] Clouds on the Moon blocking sunlight
:::

::: {.notes}
2–3 min. Correct: C. The Sun always lights half the Moon; we see different fractions of that lit half.
:::

---

## Phases Are NOT Shadows {background-color="black"}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
{{< img moon-phases-not-shadows width="100%" >}}
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
::: {.text-lg .font-semibold}
Phases are not Earth’s shadow.
:::

::: {.fragment .mt-3 .text-muted .text-sm}
If phases were Earth’s shadow, we’d have an “almost-eclipse” basically every night.
:::
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
3–5 min. Make it observational: crescent moons appear near the Sun in the sky; Earth’s shadow points away from the Sun.
:::

---

## The Key Insight {background-color="black"}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
{{< img moon-half-always-lit width="100%" >}}
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
::: {.text-lg .font-semibold}
The Sun illuminates **half of the Moon** at all times.
:::

::: {.fragment .mt-3 .text-muted}
The phase is: **how much of that lit half you can see from Earth.**
:::
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
5–7 min. Say: "The Moon isn’t changing. Your viewing angle is changing."
:::

---

## A Mental Model: Lamp + Ball {background-color="black"}

::: {.text-lg}
Imagine a tennis ball under one lamp:
:::

::: {.incremental}
- The lamp lights one hemisphere (**always 50%**).
- Walk around the ball.
- The **lit fraction you can see** changes smoothly.
:::

::: {.fragment .mt-3 .text-muted}
Moon phases are this exact demo — just with the Sun as the lamp and Earth as your viewpoint.
:::

::: {.notes}
7–8 min. Keep it simple. No diagrams yet; set up intuition.
:::

---

## The Phase Cycle (Geometry Map) {background-color="black"}

{{< img moon-phase-cycle width="92%" class="img-center" >}}

::: {.notes}
8–10 min. Walk around the orbit: new → waxing crescent → first quarter → waxing gibbous → full → waning gibbous → third quarter → waning crescent.
:::

---

## Why ~29.5 Days? {background-color="black"}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}
{{< img moon-phases-synodic-month width="100%" >}}
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
::: {.bg-muted .p-2 .text-xs .leading-tight}
**Sidereal month** ≈ 27.3 days (relative to the stars)  
**Synodic month** ≈ 29.5 days (new → new)

Earth moves around the Sun, so the **Sun-direction shifts** during one Moon orbit.  
The Moon must **catch up** to re-align → about **2 extra days**.

**Main takeaway:** phases track the **Sun-direction**, not the background stars.
:::
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
10–11 min. The “lol why 29.5?” slide. Emphasize: phases are locked to the Sun-direction, not the stars.

If you want the quantitative version (say it, don’t show it):
- Moon’s orbital speed ≈ 360°/27.3 d ≈ 13.2°/day, so catching up ~27° takes ~2.1 days.
- Optional compact relation: 1/P_syn = 1/P_sid − 1/P_year.
:::

---

## Quick Check: Where Is “First Quarter”? {background-color="#1a1a2e"}

::: {.quiz}
At **first quarter**, the Moon is:

- [ ] Between Earth and the Sun
- [ ] 90° away from the Sun (as seen from Earth)
- [ ] Opposite the Sun in the sky
- [ ] In Earth’s shadow
:::

::: {.notes}
10–11 min. Correct: B. First/third quarter corresponds to a 90° Sun–Earth–Moon angle.
:::

---

## “Waxing” vs “Waning” (Translation) {background-color="black"}

::: {.text-center .text-xl}
Waxing = getting brighter each night
:::

::: {.fragment .text-center .text-xl .mt-2}
Waning = getting dimmer each night
:::

::: {.fragment .text-center .text-muted .mt-3}
Growing/waning is about **time direction**, not left vs right on the Moon.
:::

::: {.notes}
11–12 min. Students often memorize “right side lit means waxing” which fails in the southern hemisphere and confuses orientation. Emphasize time + where it is in the sky.
:::

---

## Moon as a Clock {background-color="black"}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
{{< img moon-as-a-clock width="100%" >}}
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
::: {.fragment .text-muted .text-sm}
If you know the **time** and you can estimate the **phase**, you can usually predict where to look.
:::
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
12–14 min. Highlight the big anchor times: new near Sun; first quarter highest near sunset; full highest near midnight; third quarter highest near sunrise.
:::

---

## Check Yourself: Evening Crescent {background-color="#1a1a2e"}

::: {.quiz}
You see a **crescent Moon** low in the **western sky just after sunset**. Is it waxing or waning?

- [ ] Waxing
- [ ] Waning
- [ ] Could be either
- [ ] Crescent moons are never visible at sunset
:::

::: {.notes}
14–15 min. Correct: waxing. Waning crescent shows up pre-dawn in the east.
:::

---

## Check Yourself: Highest at Midnight {background-color="#1a1a2e"}

::: {.quiz}
It’s midnight, and the Moon is **highest in the sky**. What phase is it?

- [ ] New Moon
- [ ] First Quarter
- [ ] Full Moon
- [ ] Third Quarter
:::

::: {.notes}
15–16 min. Correct: full moon.
:::

---

## Mini-Activity: Sketch the Geometry

::: {style="background-color: rgba(93,191,191,0.16); border-left: 6px solid #5dbfbf; border-radius: 14px; padding: 0.9rem 1.0rem; color: rgba(255,255,255,0.96);"}
::: {.text-lg .font-semibold}
✏️ 60-second sketch
:::

::: {.text-sm .leading-tight}
Draw sunlight coming from the left, Earth in the middle, and the Moon in four positions: new, first quarter, full, third quarter.

Then: for each Moon, shade the half **away from the Sun** and ask: what fraction of the lit half can Earth see?

When you're done: **compare with a neighbor**. If your sketches disagree, decide which one has the lit half always facing the Sun.
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
16–18 min.

Enforcement:
- 60 sec sketch (timer).
- 30 sec pair-check: "Show your sketch to your neighbor."
- Cold-call 2 pairs to describe (no drawing on board needed): "Where is the Sun? Which half is lit? What do we see from Earth?"
:::

## Live Demo (3 min): Moon Phases {background-image="/assets/images/common/noirlab-nightsky-mosaic.jpg" background-opacity="0.2"}

::: {.text-lg}
Open the Moon Phases demo:

::: {.text-xl .font-semibold}
[astrobytes-edu.github.io/astr101-sp26/demos/moon-phases/](https://astrobytes-edu.github.io/astr101-sp26/demos/moon-phases/)
:::

::: {.fragment .mt-3 .text-sm}
Do three quick checkpoints:
:::

::: {.incremental .text-sm}
1. **First quarter:** where is Earth’s shadow?
2. **Full moon:** where is the Moon in the sky relative to the Sun?
3. **Waning crescent:** what time of day would you expect to see it?
:::

::: {.notes}
18–21 min. Make this mandatory (tight 3 minutes).

Script:
- First quarter: turn on "Show Earth's Shadow" and ask for a quick prediction, then reveal the shadow is nowhere near the Moon.
- Full: drag to full and connect to "highest at midnight."
- Waning crescent: drag there and ask "sunrise vs sunset?"

## What Is an Eclipse? {background-color="black"}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
{{< img eclipses-when-shadows-matter width="100%" >}}
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
::: {.incremental .text-sm}
- **Solar eclipse:** Moon’s shadow falls on Earth (Moon between Sun and Earth)
- **Lunar eclipse:** Moon passes through Earth’s shadow (Earth between Sun and Moon)
:::
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
20–22 min. Keep it geometrical: alignment + shadow cones (umbra/penumbra).
:::

---

## Quick Check: Solar Eclipse Phase {background-color="#1a1a2e"}

::: {.quiz}
During a **solar eclipse**, the Moon must be at:

- [ ] Full Moon
- [ ] New Moon
- [ ] First Quarter
- [ ] Third Quarter
:::

::: {.notes}
22–23 min. Correct: new moon. Lunar eclipse corresponds to full moon.
:::

---

## Why Not Every Month? {background-color="black"}

::: {.text-lg}
If eclipses happen at **new** and **full** moon…
:::

::: {.fragment .text-lg}
…why don’t we get two eclipses every month?
:::

::: {.fragment .mt-3}
Because the Moon’s orbit is tilted by about **5°** relative to the ecliptic.
:::

::: {.notes}
23–24 min. Name the ecliptic: Earth’s orbital plane (Lecture 3).
:::

---

## Orbital Tilt Breaks the Alignment {background-color="black"}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
{{< img eclipses-5deg-difference width="100%" >}}
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
::: {.fragment .text-muted .text-sm}
Most months, the Moon passes a few degrees **above or below** the Sun (new moon) or Earth’s shadow (full moon).
:::
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
24–26 min. Emphasize: “5 degrees is enough to miss a shadow cone.”
:::

---

## Nodes = Eclipse Gateways {background-color="black"}

::: {.column width="60%"}
{{< img eclipses-nodes-why-not-monthly width="100%" >}}
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
::: {.fragment .text-muted .text-sm}
Eclipses are only possible when the Moon is near a **node** (where its orbit crosses the ecliptic).
:::
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
26–28 min. Define node: intersection points of planes. Keep it visual.
:::

---

## Live Demo (2 min): Eclipse Geometry {background-image="/assets/images/common/noirlab-nightsky-mosaic.jpg" background-opacity="0.2"}

::: {.text-lg}
Open the Eclipse Geometry demo:
:::

::: {.text-xl .font-semibold}
[astrobytes-edu.github.io/astr101-sp26/demos/eclipse-geometry/](https://astrobytes-edu.github.io/astr101-sp26/demos/eclipse-geometry/)
:::

::: {.fragment .mt-3 .text-sm}
Two fast tests:
:::

::: {.incremental .text-sm}
1. Set tilt to **0°** → new moon and full moon should always produce eclipses.
2. Restore tilt to **5.1°** → eclipses only happen when the Moon is near a **node**.
:::

::: {.notes}
28–30 min. This is the cleanest "why not monthly" proof students will remember.
:::

---

## Check Yourself: Why Eclipses Aren’t Monthly {background-color="#1a1a2e"}

::: {.quiz}
Eclipses don’t occur every month because:

- [ ] The Moon is too small to cast a significant shadow
- [ ] The Moon’s orbit is tilted relative to Earth’s orbital plane
- [ ] Earth’s atmosphere bends the Moon’s shadow away
- [ ] The Sun is too bright during most new moons
:::

::: {.notes}
28–29 min. Correct: B.
:::

---

## Sketch It: Eclipse Geometry

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
### ✏️ 90-second sketch

Draw the ecliptic as a straight line. Draw the Moon’s orbit as a tilted loop crossing the ecliptic at two nodes.

Mark new moon and full moon positions both **near a node** and **far from a node**.

Circle the cases where an eclipse is possible.

When you're done: **hold up your paper** (or show your neighbor) so we can check the logic quickly.
:::

::: {.notes}
30–32 min. Enforcement: 90 sec timer, then quick scan of the room / pair-check. Ask one student to narrate their sketch: "What has to be true at new moon for a solar eclipse?"
:::

---

## Eclipse Seasons (Same Geometry, Repeats) {background-color="black"}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
{{< img eclipses-nodes-gateways width="100%" >}}
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
::: {.fragment .text-muted .text-sm}
When the Sun is lined up near a node direction, eclipses become possible for a short window: an **eclipse season**.
:::
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
31–33 min. Conceptual only; don’t drown in timing. "Alignment windows repeat."
:::

---

## Eclipse Seasons: Numbers to Anchor It {background-color="black" .smaller}

::: {.bg-muted .p-2}
Helpful reference numbers (global):

- An **eclipse season** lasts about **34–35 days** (≈34.5 days).
- Eclipse seasons happen about **twice per year** (roughly **6 months** apart).
- Globally, there are about **2–5 solar eclipses per year** (average ≈ **2.4**).
- A single season can produce up to **three eclipses** (solar, lunar, solar) if the timing lines up.
:::

::: {.notes}
33–34 min. Emphasize "global numbers" vs "what you personally see." This sets up why eclipse chasing is a thing.
:::

---

## Eclipse Varieties {background-color="black"}

{{< img eclipse-varieties width="92%" class="img-center" >}}

::: {.notes}
33–35 min. Quick tour: partial vs total; umbra vs penumbra; solar vs lunar.
:::

## Why Does the Moon Turn Red? {background-color="black"}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
{{< img lunar-eclipse-blood-moon width="100%" >}}
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
::: {.fragment .text-muted}
During a total lunar eclipse, the Moon is lit by sunlight filtered through Earth’s atmosphere.
:::
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
35–37 min. Tie to Rayleigh scattering: blue scattered out, red survives and bends into the shadow.
:::

---

## Angular Size Decides: Total vs Annular {background-color="black"}

::: {.text-lg}
Recall (Lecture 3): Sun and Moon are both about **0.5°** across in our sky.
:::

::: {.fragment .mt-3}
But the Moon’s distance changes — so its angular size changes.
:::

::: {.fragment .mt-2 .text-muted}
If the Moon looks **bigger** than the Sun → **total** eclipse possible.

If the Moon looks **smaller** than the Sun → **annular** eclipse (ring).
:::

::: {.notes}
37–39 min. Keep it conceptual: angular size ∝ physical size / distance.
:::

---

## Check Yourself: What If the Moon Were Farther? {background-color="#1a1a2e"}

::: {.quiz}
If the Moon were **20% farther** from Earth than it is now, solar eclipses would be:

- [ ] More frequent
- [ ] Always total
- [ ] Always annular (never total)
- [ ] Exactly the same
:::

::: {.notes}
39–40 min. Correct: always annular. Farther → smaller angular size.
:::

---

## One Wild Fact (Optional) {background-color="black"}

::: {.text-center .text-xl}
Total solar eclipses are temporary.
:::

::: {.fragment .mt-3 .text-lg}
The Moon is slowly receding from Earth (about **3.8 cm/year**).
:::

::: {.fragment .mt-2 .text-muted}
Far in the future, the Moon will look too small to fully cover the Sun.
:::

::: {.notes}
Optional 60 sec. Keep it as “cool preview” tied to tides/rotation later.
:::

---

## The Big Picture (One Slide Summary) {background-image="/assets/images/common/noirlab-nightsky-mosaic.jpg" background-opacity="0.2"}

::: {.bg-muted .p-2}
**Phases:** not shadows → changing **viewing angle** of the Moon’s sunlit half.

**Eclipses:** shadows → rare **alignment** + near a **node**.

**Total vs annular:** **angular size** (Moon distance) decides whether the Sun can be fully covered.
:::

::: {.notes}
Wrap. Ask: "If you remember one thing: draw the geometry."
:::

---

## Exit Ticket {background-color="#1a1a2e"}

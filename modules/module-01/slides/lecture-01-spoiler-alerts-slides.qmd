::: notes
Don’t read the small text on this infographic. It’s a **map**, not a quiz.

Point once to each region (quick tour):

1) **Left: “The Inference Pipeline”**
   - These are the only four kinds of things we can directly measure from far away:
     **brightness**, **position**, **wavelength**, **timing**.
   - Everything else we talk about in astronomy is built from these + physics.

2) **Middle: the telescope**
   - Telescopes don’t “take pictures” the way your phone does.
   - They collect **photons** and turn them into numbers: counts, angles, spectra, time series.

3) **Right: “The Decoder Ring”**
   - The decoder ring is the move we repeat all semester:
     **signal → measurement → model → inference**.
   - The key promise of the course: we’ll make the “model” step explicit, so you can see what assumptions are being made.

4) **Bottom: two ideas to tag for later**
   - **Wavelength is physics**: different wavelengths show different temperatures/processes.
   - **Distance is a time dial**: because light takes time to travel, looking farther means looking farther into the past.

Close the slide with:
“Today is just the trailer. If you recognize these ingredients when they show up later, you’re doing it right.”

## The Four Things We Can Actually Measure (Directly) {background-color="black"}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
{{< img four-observables class="img-center" >}}
:::
::: {.column width="40%"}

**Direct observables (inputs):**

::: {.incremental}
- **Brightness** (flux)
- **Position** (angles + changes)
- **Wavelength** (spectrum/color)
- **Timing** (variability)
:::

::: {.text-sm .text-muted .mt-2}
Everything else is inferred using physics.
:::
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
4–6 min.

These four are the only “inputs” the universe gives us.

Don’t over-explain yet—just name them and point to each icon in the figure.

If you want a one-liner to land: “Everything else we care about is a calculation.”

## Models Are the Bridge (“Decoder Ring”) {background-color="black"}

::: {.text-center .text-base .text-muted .mt-0}
Pretty pictures → measurements → **models** → inferences
:::

:::: {.columns .mt-2}
::: {.column width="45%"}
**What we can directly measure:**

- **Brightness** (flux)
- **Position** (angles + changes)
- **Wavelength** (spectrum/color)
- **Timing** (variability)
:::
::: {.column width="55%"}
**What a model does:**

- A **model** is a mathematical relationship that encodes physical assumptions.
- It’s the “decoder ring” that turns an observable into a physical claim.

::: {.text-sm .text-muted .mt-2}
Without models, astronomy is just a catalog of points of light.
:::
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
6–7 min.

Say explicitly: “An inference is only as strong as the model that connects what we measured to what we’re claiming.”

Concrete anchor (optional, don’t derive): the inverse-square law connects measured flux to luminosity and distance:
$F = L/(4\\pi d^2)$.

## Quick Check: What Can We Measure Directly? {background-color="#1a1a2e"}

::: {.quiz}
Which can astronomers *directly* measure for a distant star?

- [ ] Temperature
- [x] Apparent brightness
- [ ] Mass
- [ ] Age
:::

::: {.notes}
7–8 min.

Give ~20–30 seconds: “Don’t overthink—what can we measure *directly*?”

Then confirm: **apparent brightness** is a direct measurement; temperature/mass/age are inferences.

::: {.notes}
8–9 min. **HR Diagram construction from Omega Centauri.**

Watch what happens when astronomers sort stars by two observables: brightness and color. A pattern emerges.

The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is one of astronomy's greatest tools—and it's built entirely from *things we can measure*. No magic. Just careful observation and pattern recognition.

**Key message:** Astronomers are pattern hunters. Sort the data, find the structure, discover the physics.

:::
::::

::: {.notes}
10–12 min.

**Measure:** colors at specific wavelengths (e.g., red Hα; blue-green [OIII]).

**Infer:** hydrogen vs oxygen emission; dark lanes = dust blocking light.

**Physics:** atomic physics: discrete transitions → discrete wavelengths.

**Key insight:** Color isn't decoration—it's encoded physics.

11–13 min. **Trifid and Lagoon Nebulae from Rubin Observatory.**

Made from 678 exposures in just over seven hours. Point out:

- **Rich reds and pinks** = hydrogen-alpha emission (656 nm) — active star formation
- **Blue and turquoise** = reflected starlight and glowing oxygen ([OIII], 495–501 nm)
- **Dark lanes and golden clouds** = dense dust absorbing visible light

This is exactly what we just discussed: color = physics.
:::

---

## Quick Check: Why Specific Colors? {background-color="#1a1a2e"}

::: {.quiz}
Why do nebulae glow at *specific* colors?

- [ ] Telescopes filter other colors
- [x] Each element emits at specific wavelengths
- [ ] Hot gas always glows red
- [ ] Colors are added artificially
:::

::: {.notes}
11–12 min.

Correct: each element has a unique set of wavelengths it can emit/absorb (a spectral fingerprint).

:::

::: {.bg-muted .p-2 .mt-1}
**Physics:** inverse-square law + standard candles
:::
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
12–14 min.

**Measure:** apparent brightness (flux) of objects whose true luminosity we can determine (“standard candles”).

**Infer:** distances much farther than parallax can reach.

**Physics:** inverse-square law: $F = L / (4\\pi d^2)$.

**Key insight:** Distance is inferred from brightness.

Cepheids pulse with period related to luminosity.
Type Ia supernovae have consistent peak brightness.

Measure flux + know luminosity → calculate distance.

::: {style="position: relative; height: 100%;"}
{{< media rr-lyrae-rubin width="100%" height="100%" >}}
:::

::: {.notes}
15–17 min. **46 pulsating RR Lyrae stars from Rubin Observatory.**

Watch the stars pulse. RR Lyrae are **standard candles** — their pulsation period tells us their intrinsic luminosity.

Over the next 10 years, Rubin will detect up to 100,000 of these stars extending more than a million light-years away, mapping the outer reaches of our Galaxy.

**This is the cosmic distance ladder in action.** Measure how bright they appear, know how bright they are, calculate how far.
:::

---

## Spoiler 3: Origin of the Elements {background-color="black"}

{{< img periodic-table-origins >}}

::: {.notes}
15–17 min.

**Measure:** Spectral fingerprints.

**Infer:** The periodic table is a fossil record of cosmic processes.

**Physics:** Nuclear reactions have specific products.

**Key insight:** Stars don't just shine—they manufacture atoms. You are starstuff.
:::

---

## Spoiler 4: Spectroscopy {background-color="black"}

{{< img prism-spectrum >}}

::: {.notes}
17–19 min.

**CRITICAL SLIDE — EXACT SCRIPT:**

"This slide is one of the most important in the entire course. Spectroscopy is how astronomy stops being pictures and starts being physics. If one idea from today sticks, let it be this one."
:::

---

## {background-color="black"}

{{< img quantum-barcode >}}

::: {.notes}
19–21 min.

**Measure:** Brightness vs. wavelength.

**Infer:** Temperature, composition, velocity.

**Physics:** Atoms have quantized energy levels. Electron jumps → photons at exact wavelengths.

A prism transforms one brightness into thousands of data points.
:::

---

## Quick Check: What Does “Temperature” Really Come From? {background-color="#1a1a2e"}

::: {.quiz}
A headline says: “Scientists measure the temperature of a distant star.”

What did they most directly measure?

- [ ] Brightness
- [ ] Position
- [x] Wavelength (spectrum/color)
- [ ] Timing
:::

::: notes
~1 min.

Now this is fair: we’ve introduced spectra as “brightness vs wavelength.”

Land: temperature is an inference; wavelength/spectrum is the measurement channel that carries temperature information.
:::

---

## Think–Pair–Share {background-image="/assets/images/module-01/prism-spectrum-nblm.png" background-opacity="0.15"}

**Why is spectroscopy the most powerful tool in astronomy?**

::: {.incremental}
1. **Think** (30 s): What does a spectrum reveal that brightness alone cannot?
2. **Pair** (90 s): Discuss with neighbor
3. **Share**: I'll call on pairs
:::

::: {.notes}
21–24 min. Expected answers: reveals temperature, composition, velocity; transforms one measurement into thousands of data points.

---

## Spoiler 5: The EM Spectrum {background-color="black"}

{{< img em-spectrum-temperature >}}

::: {.notes}
24–26 min.

**Measure:** Photons across all wavelengths.

**Infer:** Different wavelengths = different temperatures.

**Physics:** Hotter → shorter wavelength.

**Key insight:** The EM spectrum is a temperature ladder.
:::

---

## Spoiler 6: Same Galaxy, Different Physics {background-color="black"}

{{< img m51-optical-radio >}}

::: {.notes}
26–28 min.

Left (optical): Stars and dust lanes.
Right (radio/21-cm): Cold neutral hydrogen gas.

**Key insight:** Same object + different wavelength = different component visible.
:::

---

## Spoiler 7: Infrared Beats Dust {background-color="black"}

{{< img pillars-hubble-jwst >}}

::: {.notes}
28–30 min.

Left (Hubble optical): Dark, opaque pillars.
Right (JWST infrared): Thousands of hidden newborn stars.

**Key insight:** What you can't see at one wavelength might be brilliant at another.
:::

---

## Spoiler 8: Many Windows, One Truth {background-color="black"}

{{< img crab-multiwavelength >}}

::: {.notes}
30–32 min.

- Radio = magnetic fields
- Infrared = warm dust
- Optical = ionized gas from 1054 CE supernova
- X-ray = hot plasma and pulsar jets

**Key insight:** Only by combining wavelengths do we understand complex systems.
:::

---

## Spoiler 9: The Dark Universe {background-color="black"}

{{< img lsst-cosmic-treasure-chest >}}

::: {.notes}
32–34 min.

**Measure:** Velocities via Doppler shifts.

**Infer:** Galaxies rotate too fast. ~6× more mass than we can see.

**Physics:** $v^2 = GM/r$. Measure $v$ and $r$, solve for $M$.

**Key insight:** We don't know what most of the universe is made of.
:::

---

## The Cosmic Web {background-color="black"}

{{< img desi-3d-map >}}

34–36 min.

Galaxies form filaments, walls, voids—the cosmic web.

Dark matter's signature at the largest scales. And it's still evolving: gravity is still pulling structures together.

**Measure:** Supernova brightness + redshift.

**Infer:** Universe is 13.8 Gyr old. Expansion is accelerating.

:::

::: {.fragment}
**X-rays probe million-degree plasma. Radio probes cold gas.**
:::

::: {.notes}
48–49 min. **THE PUNCHLINE:**

This is why different wavelengths reveal different physics. It takes hot, violent processes to produce high-energy (short-wavelength) photons.

- Radio photons: cold gas, magnetic fields
- Visible photons: stellar surfaces (~5000 K)
- X-ray photons: million-degree plasma, black hole accretion

**Key insight:** The EM spectrum isn't arbitrary—it's a temperature/energy ladder organized by physics.

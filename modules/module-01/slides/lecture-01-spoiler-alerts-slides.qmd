**THE REVEAL (3 min):**

Say: "When you look up at the night sky, you see stars, planets, maybe the Andromeda galaxy if you know where to look. But in that video, most of those points of light weren't stars at all — they were *galaxies*. Each one containing hundreds of billions of stars."

Let that land. Pause.

Then: "And we're going to learn how to read them."
:::

## How Do We Know That? {background-image="/assets/images/common/cosmic-cliffs-jwst.png" background-opacity="0.3"}

::: {.text-center .text-lg .text-muted}
We've never been to another galaxy.

We've never touched a star.

We can't send a probe to most of what we study.
:::

::: {.fragment .text-center .text-xl .font-semibold .mt-4}
So how do astronomers know *anything* about objects trillions of kilometers away?
:::

::: {.fragment .text-center .text-sm .text-muted .mt-2}
(Later today: why astronomers switch to **light-years** (and **parsecs**) for cosmic distances.)
:::

::: {.notes}
4–5 min.

This is the central question of the course.

Don't answer it yet — just plant the question.

"This course is about answering that question. Not just *what* we know, but *how* we know it."
:::

## Today Is a Trailer {background-image="/assets/images/common/cosmic-cliffs-jwst.png" background-opacity="0.4"}

::: {.bg-muted .p-2}

**By the end of today, you'll be able to...**

::: {.incremental}
- State the course thesis: **pretty pictures → measurements → models → inferences**
- Name the 4 things we can directly measure: **brightness, position, wavelength, timing**
- Explain why wavelength is the most powerful: it encodes **temperature, composition, and motion**
:::

:::

::: {.notes}
5–6 min.

Say: "Today is just a trailer — like a movie preview. You're not expected to master anything today. You're expected to *recognize* these ideas when they come back."

Emphasize: Recognition, not retention.
:::

---

## The Course Thesis {background-color="black"}

::: {.text-center .text-lg .font-semibold .mt-4}
[Pretty pictures → measurements →<br> models → inferences]{.rn rn-type="underline" rn-color="#5dbfbf"}
:::

::: {.fragment .text-sm .bg-muted .p-2 .mt-4}
**What this means:**

- Astronomical images aren't just beautiful — they're **data**
- We extract **measurements** from that data (how bright, what color, where, when)
- We apply **physical models** to interpret those measurements
- The result is an **inference** — a conclusion about something we can't directly access
:::

::: {.notes}
6–7 min.

This is the single most important idea of the entire course.

Repeat it: "Pretty pictures are data. Data becomes measurements. Models interpret measurements. The result is an inference."

An inference is a claim about reality based on evidence + reasoning.
:::

---

## We Cannot Touch the Stars {background-image="/assets/images/common/eso-milky-way-panoramic.jpg" background-opacity="0.25"}

::: {.text-center .text-lg .text-muted}
Astronomy is the art of inferring physical reality from constrained measurements.
:::

::: {.bg-muted .p-2 .mt-4}
**Constraint:** We can only study the light that reaches us.

- No thermometers in the Sun
- No tape measures to galaxies
- No scales to weigh

Everything we claim to know is **inferred from light**.
:::

::: {.notes}
7–8 min.

This is a constraint, not a limitation — it's what makes astronomy a science of clever inference.

"We cannot touch the stars. We can only decode the light they send us."
:::

---

## {.full-bleed background-image="/assets/images/module-01/decoding-the-cosmos-infographic.webp" background-opacity="1" background-size="contain" background-position="center" background-color="black"}

::: {.notes}
8–9 min. **Don't read the infographic aloud.** It's a map, not a quiz.

Quick tour (point to each region):

1. **Left: "The Four Observables"** — brightness, position, wavelength, timing. These are the only things we can directly measure.

2. **Center: the telescope** — collects photons and turns them into numbers.

3. **Right: "The Decoder Ring"** — the repeated move: signal → measurement → model → inference.

4. **Bottom: two key ideas** — wavelength is physics (different wavelengths = different processes); distance is a time dial (looking far = looking back in time).

Close with: "Today is just the trailer. If you recognize these ingredients later, you're doing it right."
:::

## NASA's Three Big Questions {background-color="black"}

{{< img three-big-questions width="70%" class="img-center" >}}

::: {.text-center .text-sm .text-muted .mt-1}
**Think:** Which question are you most curious about?
:::

::: {.notes}
9–10 min.

Quick hand poll or pair-share: "Which of these three questions draws you in?"

Then: "Here's the amazing part — we answer all three using the same method: Measure → Infer → test with models."

Don't linger. This is motivation, not content.
:::

---

## What Can We Actually Measure?

::: {.text-center .text-base .font-semibold .text-muted}
From billions of kilometers away, we can directly measure only **four things**.
:::

{{< img four-direct-observables-nblm width="70%" class="img-center" >}}


::: {.notes}
10–12 min.

1. **How bright?** — brightness (energy emitted per second per area)
2. **Where is it?** — position (angles on the sky)
3. **What color?** — wavelength (spectrum)
4. **When does it change?** — timing (variability)

Everything else — distance, mass, temperature, age — is **calculated**.

Emphasize: "These are the only inputs the universe gives us. Everything else is a calculation."

Technical note: Astronomers call brightness "flux" — the amount of energy passing through a unit area per second (e.g., W/m²). The "per area" matters because a bigger telescope collects more light.

Don't over-explain yet. Just name them and let the spoiler reel show examples.
:::

---

## The Four Observables {background-color="black"}

:::: {.columns style="column-gap: 2rem;"}
::: {.column width="55%"}
{{< img four-observables class="img-center" >}}
:::
::: {.column width="40%"}

**Direct observables (what we measure):**

::: {.text-sm}
- **Brightness** — how much energy arrives per second
- **Position** — where on the sky, and how it moves
- **Wavelength** — what colors/spectrum are present
- **Timing** — how brightness or position changes over time
:::

:::
::::

::: {.notes}
12–13 min.

Point to each icon in the figure as you say the name.

"These four are our entire toolkit. Every claim about the universe is built from these four measurements plus physics."
:::

---

## Quick Check: Direct Measurement {background-color="#1a1a2e"}

::: {.quiz}
Which of these can astronomers *directly* measure for a distant star?

- [ ] Temperature
- [ ] Apparent brightness
- [ ] Mass
- [ ] Age
:::

::: {.notes}
13–14 min. Give ~30 seconds.

Correct: **apparent brightness** is a direct measurement.

Temperature, mass, and age are all *inferences* — they require models to calculate from what we actually measure.
:::

---

## The Spoiler Reel {background-image="/assets/images/module-01/lsst-cosmic-treasure-chest-zoom.jpg" background-opacity="0.3"}

::: {.text-center .text-xs .text-muted}
*For each image, don't memorize details — identify the pattern.*
:::

::: {.layout-grid-2 .mt-4}

::: {.bg-muted .p-2}
**What do we measure?**

(Which of the 4 observables?)
:::

::: {.bg-muted .p-2}
**What do we infer?**

(What physical claim do we make?)
:::

:::

::: {.fragment .text-center .text-base .font-semibold .mt-2}
Same pattern every time:<br> **Observable → Model → Physical Reality**
:::

::: {.notes}
14–15 min.

Orientation: "This is the repeatable structure for the whole course. I'm going to show you 7 examples. For each one, ask yourself: what did we measure, and what did we conclude?"
:::

### Spoiler 1: Nebulae — Colors Are Chemistry

:::: {.columns style="column-gap: 2rem;"}
::: {.column width="60%"}
{{< img forensic-nebula class="img-center" >}}

:::
::: {.column width="40%"}

::: {.bg-muted .text-sm}
**We measure:** Colors at specific wavelengths

**We infer:** Chemical composition and dust structure

**The physics:** Each element emits/absorbs at unique wavelengths — a "spectral fingerprint"
:::

:::
::::
::: {.fragment .text-xs .text-muted .mt-2}
*Red = hydrogen (656 nm)*
*Blue-green = oxygen (500 nm)*
*Dark lanes = dust blocking light*
:::

::: {.notes}
15–17 min.

Key insight: "Colors aren't decoration — they're encoded physics. The red glow is hydrogen, the blue-green is oxygen, and the dark lanes are dust silhouettes."

This is spectroscopy in action: different elements = different colors = different wavelengths.
:::

---

## {.full-bleed background-color="black"}

::: {style="position: relative; height: 100%;"}
{{< media trifid-lagoon-rubin width="100%" height="100%" >}}
:::

::: {.notes}
17–18 min. **Trifid and Lagoon Nebulae from Rubin Observatory.**

Made from 678 exposures in just over seven hours.

Point out:

- **Reds and pinks** = hydrogen emission (656 nm) — active star formation
- **Blue and turquoise** = reflected starlight and oxygen emission
- **Dark lanes** = dense dust absorbing visible light

"This is exactly what we just discussed: color = physics."
:::

---

## Quick Check: Why Specific Colors? {background-color="#1a1a2e"}

::: {.quiz}
Why do nebulae glow at *specific* colors instead of a continuous rainbow?

- [ ] Telescopes filter out other colors
- [ ] Each chemical element emits at specific wavelengths
- [ ] Hot gas always glows red
- [ ] The colors are added artificially by scientists
:::

::: {.notes}
18–19 min. Give ~30 seconds.

Correct: **Each element has a unique set of wavelengths** it can emit or absorb — like a fingerprint.

This is one of the most powerful facts in astronomy: we can identify what things are made of from light-years away.
:::

---

## Spoiler 2: Spectroscopy — The Master Key {.compact background-color="black"}

:::: {.columns style="column-gap: 2rem;"}
::: {.column width="45%"}
{{< img prism-spectrum class="img-center" >}}
:::
::: {.column width="55%"}
::: {.text-sm}
::: {.bg-muted}
**We measure:** Brightness at each wavelength (a spectrum)

**We infer:** Temperature, composition, and motion

**The physics:** Atoms have quantized energy levels — electrons can only jump between specific rungs
:::

::: {.fragment .mt-2}
**Why it's the master key:**

A single brightness measurement = 1 data point.
A spectrum = **thousands** of data points.
:::

:::
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
19–21 min.

**CRITICAL SLIDE:**

"This is one of the most important ideas in the entire course. Spectroscopy is how astronomy stops being pictures and starts being physics."

A prism reveals that white light contains many wavelengths. By measuring brightness at each wavelength, we get temperature, composition, and velocity — all from light.
:::

---

## The Quantum Barcode {background-color="black"}

{{< img quantum-barcode width="80%" class="img-center" >}}

::: {.notes}
21–22 min.

Walk through the three types of spectra:

1. **Continuous** — hot dense source produces a rainbow
2. **Absorption** — cool gas in front absorbs specific wavelengths (dark lines)
3. **Emission** — hot thin gas emits specific wavelengths (bright lines)

The pattern of lines is unique to each element — like a barcode or fingerprint.

"If you see these lines in starlight, you know that element is present. We don't have to go there — the light carries the information."
:::

---

## Spoiler 3: The Cosmic Distance Ladder {background-color="black"}

:::: {.columns .text-sm style="column-gap: 2rem;"}
::: {.column width="55%"}
{{< img cosmic-distance-ladder class="img-center" >}}
:::
::: {.column width="45%"}

::: {.bg-muted .p-2}
**We measure:** How bright an object appears (flux)

**We infer:** How far away it is

**The physics:** Light spreads out as it travels<br> — if you know the true brightness, you can calculate distance
:::

:::
::::

::: {.fragment .text-center .text-sm .text-muted .mt-2}
*A dim nearby source can look identical to a bright distant one<br> — physics breaks the tie.*
:::

::: {.notes}
22–24 min.

The key insight: "Distance is not something we measure directly. We measure brightness and use physics to calculate distance."

The "ladder" means each method calibrates the next — nearby stars calibrate variable stars, which calibrate supernovae, which reach across the universe.
:::

---

## Standard Candles: Know the Brightness, Calculate the Distance {background-color="black"}

:::: {.columns style="column-gap: 2rem;"}
::: {.column width="50%"}
{{< img standard-candles class="img-center" >}}

:::{.text-xs}
- Pulsating stars (period → luminosity)
- Exploding white dwarfs<br> (same mass → same brightness)
:::
:::
::: {.column width="50%" .text-sm}

**The key idea:** If you know how bright something *actually is* (luminosity), and you measure how bright it *appears* (flux), you can calculate distance.

::: {.fragment .bg-muted .p-2 .mt-2}
**Standard candles:** Objects whose true brightness we can predict from physics.

:::

:::
::::

::: {.notes}
24–25 min.

Don't introduce equations. Just the concept: "If I know a lightbulb is 100 watts and I measure how bright it appears, I can calculate how far away it is."

Cepheids pulse with a period related to their luminosity. Type Ia supernovae have consistent peak brightness because physics sets a limit on how massive a white dwarf can be.
:::

---

## {.full-bleed background-color="black"}

::: {style="position: relative; height: 100%;"}
{{< media rr-lyrae-rubin width="100%" height="100%" >}}
:::

::: {.notes}
25–26 min. **46 pulsating RR Lyrae stars from Rubin Observatory.**

Watch the stars pulse. RR Lyrae are standard candles — their pulsation period tells us their true luminosity.

Over 10 years, Rubin will detect up to 100,000 of these stars extending more than a million light-years away.

"This is the cosmic distance ladder in action. Measure how bright they appear, know how bright they are, calculate how far."
:::

---

## Spoiler 4: Same Galaxy, Different Physics {background-color="black"}

:::: {.columns style="column-gap: 2rem;" .text-sm}
::: {.column width="45%"}
{{< img m51-optical-radio class="img-center" >}}

:::

::: {.column width="55%"}
::: {.bg-muted}
**We measure:** The same galaxy at different wavelengths

**We infer:** Different physical components are visible at different wavelengths

**The physics:** Different emission processes dominate at different wavelengths
:::

:::
::::

::: {.text-xs .text-muted}
**Left (optical):** Stars and dust lanes

**Right (radio):** Cold hydrogen gas
:::

::: {.notes}
26–28 min.

Key insight: "Same object, different wavelength, different structures visible."

Optical light comes from stellar surfaces. Radio waves (21-cm) come from cold hydrogen gas. The gas extends beyond the visible stellar disk.

This is why astronomers need many kinds of telescopes — not for "better" pictures, but for different physics.
:::

---

## Spoiler 5: Infrared Reveals Hidden Stars {background-color="black"}

:::: {.columns style="column-gap: 2rem;"}
::: {.column width="60%"}
{{< img pillars-hubble-jwst class="img-center" >}}
:::
::: {.column width="40%"}
::: {.bg-muted .text-xs}
**We measure:** Optical vs infrared light from the same region

**We infer:** Newborn stars can hide inside dusty clouds

**The physics:** Dust blocks/scatters short wavelengths more than long wavelengths
:::

::: {.fragment .text-xs .mt-2}
**Left (Hubble):** Dark, opaque pillars

**Right (JWST):** Thousands of hidden newborn stars revealed
:::

:::
::::

::: {.notes}
28–30 min.

The Pillars of Creation in the Eagle Nebula.

Key insight: "What you can't see at one wavelength might be brilliant at another. Infrared penetrates dust that blocks visible light."

This is why JWST was built to see infrared — to peer into star-forming regions where visible light can't reach.
:::

---

## Spoiler 6: Hidden Mass — The Dark Matter Problem {.compact background-color="black"}

:::: {.columns style="column-gap: 2rem;"}
::: {.column width="60%"}
{{< img lsst-cosmic-treasure-chest class="img-center" >}}
:::
::: {.column width="40%"}
::: {.bg-muted .text-sm}
**We measure:** how galaxies and stars move (from spectra over time)

**We infer:** extra unseen mass (“dark matter”)

**The physics:** gravity links motion to mass; if objects move too fast, there must be more mass than we can see
:::
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
30–31 min.

"Dark matter is an inference from motion: we measure how things move (using Doppler shifts), and gravity tells us how much mass must be there."
"When the required mass is bigger than the stars + gas we can see, we’ve discovered missing mass: dark matter."
:::

---

## Spoiler 7: The Cosmic Web — Mapping the Universe in 3D {.compact background-color="black"}

:::: {.columns style="column-gap: 2rem;"}
::: {.column width="60%"}
{{< img desi-3d-map class="img-center" >}}
:::
::: {.column width="40%"}
::: {.bg-muted .text-sm}
**We measure:** spectra (wavelength shifts) → redshifts → distances → 3D positions

**We infer:** the cosmic web (filaments + voids) and expansion-history constraints

**The physics:** gravity + cosmic expansion shape large-scale structure; mapping it tests cosmological models
:::

:::
::::

::: {.notes}
31–33 min.

Point to: filaments (where galaxies cluster), voids (empty spaces).

"We measure spectra and get redshifts—wavelengths stretched by cosmic expansion. Redshift gives us distance, so we can map galaxies in 3D."
"The pattern isn’t random—gravity and expansion sculpt this web."
:::

---

## Spoiler 8: The Universe Is "Dark" {background-color="black"}
::: {.text-center .text-sm}
*Dark Matter + Dark Energy*
:::

:::: {.columns style="column-gap: 2rem;"}
::: {.column width="60%"}
::: {.bg-muted .text-sm}
**We measure:** how the expansion rate changes with time *(distance + redshift)*

**We infer:** the expansion is accelerating → “dark energy”

**The physics:** gravity + cosmic expansion link energy content to expansion. 

*Acceleration implies a component that acts like “repulsive gravity”*

:::
:::
::: {.column width="40%"}
{{< img universe-contents-nasa class="img-center" >}}
:::
::::

**Big question:** *How does dark energy evolve?*

::: {.notes}
33–34 min.

“We don’t start with a ‘dark energy meter’. We measure distances + redshifts, build an expansion history, and then infer what kind of energy content could produce it.”

Quantitative anchor (as shown in the NASA graphic): ~5% normal matter, ~27% dark matter, ~68% dark energy.

Emphasize: “We can describe the universe with numbers — but we still don’t know what ~95% of it *is*.”
:::

---

## History of the Universe {background-color="black"}

{{< img universe-history-nasa width="85%" class="img-center" >}}

::: {.notes}
Say: "This is the punchline: the universe has a history—and by the end of this course, you’ll be able to explain the story on this timeline, and how we know it."
:::

---

## Spoiler Synthesis: The Pattern Repeats {background-color="black"}

::: {.text-center .text-lg .font-semibold}
Every spoiler followed the same structure:
:::

::: {.text-center .text-xl .mt-4}
**Observable → Model → Physical Reality**
:::

::: {.fragment .bg-muted .p-2 .mt-4 .text-center}
**Which observable appeared most often?**

*(Hint: it starts with "W")*
:::

::: {.notes}
33–34 min. **SYNTHESIS MOMENT**

Ask: "Which of the four observables kept showing up?" → **Wavelength** (spectrum).

"Spectroscopy — measuring brightness at each wavelength — is the workhorse of astronomy. It shows up in almost everything we do."
:::

---

## Lookback Time: Distance Is a Time Machine {background-color="black"}

:::: {.columns style="column-gap: 2rem;"}
::: {.column width="55%"}
{{< img universe-time-machine class="img-center" >}}
:::
::: {.column width="45%"}
::: {.table-scroll .text-sm}
| Object | You see it as it was... |
|---|---|
| The Moon | 1.3 seconds ago |
| The Sun | 8 minutes ago |
| Andromeda Galaxy | 2.5 million years ago |
| Distant galaxies | Billions of years ago |
:::

:::
::::

::: {.fragment .bg-muted .p-2 .text-center .mt-2}
**Looking far away means looking into the past.**
:::

::: {.notes}
34–36 min.

Light takes time to travel. When we look at the Moon, we see it as it was 1.3 seconds ago. The Sun: 8 minutes ago.

For distant galaxies, we're literally seeing the past — billions of years ago.

"This isn't a limitation — it's a feature. Distance is a time dial that lets us see cosmic history."
:::

---

## What's a Light-Year? {background-color="black"}

::: {.text-center .text-lg}
A **light-year** is a unit of **distance**, not time.
:::

::: {.bg-muted .p-2 .mt-4}
**Definition:** The distance light travels in one year.
:::

::: {.fragment .text-center .text-muted .mt-2}
When we say a galaxy is "100 million light-years away,"
we mean its light traveled for **100 million years** to reach us.
:::

::: {.notes}
35–36 min.

**Common misconception:** Students often think light-year is a time unit because it has "year" in the name.

Emphasize: "Light-year *sounds* like time, but it's actually distance. It's how far light can travel in a year."

The scientific notation here previews Thursday's math boot camp:
- 3 × 10⁵ = 300,000 (move decimal 5 places right)
- 9.5 × 10¹² = 9,500,000,000,000 (9.5 trillion)

This is why we need scientific notation — these numbers are unwieldy otherwise.

Note: astronomers often use **parsecs** in practice; **light-years** are common in outreach because they’re intuitive.
:::

---

## How big is a light-year? {background-color="black"}

::: {.bg-muted .p-2 .mt-2}
::: {.text-sm}
- Light speed: 300,000 km/s (3 × 10⁵ km/s)
- One year: ~31.5 million seconds (3.15 × 10⁷ s)
- **1 light-year ≈ 9.5 trillion km (9.5 × 10¹² km)**
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
Do this. This is the first “math moment” and sets up Thursday’s math boot camp. Time-box to ~60–90 seconds.
:::

---

## Quick Check: Lookback Time {background-color="#1a1a2e"}

::: {.quiz}
You observe a galaxy **100 million light-years** away.

When did the light you're seeing *leave* that galaxy?

- [ ] 100 million years ago
- [ ] Right now
- [ ] 13.8 billion years ago
- [ ] It depends on the telescope
:::

::: {.notes}
36–37 min. Give ~30 seconds.

Correct: **100 million years ago**.

A light-year is the distance light travels in one year. If something is 100 million light-years away, its light took 100 million years to reach us.
:::

## Wavelength Is Energy {background-color="black"}

**The key relationship:**

For thermal light: shorter wavelength = higher photon energy = hotter source

- **Gamma/X-ray:** Million-degree plasma, black holes
- **Visible:** Stellar surfaces (3,000–50,000 K)
- **Infrared/Radio:** Dust and cold gas (10–100 K)

This is why different telescopes see different physics — not just "better pictures."

"The electromagnetic spectrum isn't arbitrary — it's organized by energy. Hot, violent processes produce short wavelengths (X-rays, gamma rays). Cold, quiet processes produce long wavelengths (radio)."

This is why we need X-ray telescopes for black holes and radio telescopes for cold gas.

Note: some emission is non-thermal (not a simple thermometer). We’ll learn those cases later.

## What You Can Recognize Now {background-color="black"}

::: {.bg-muted .p-2}

After today, you should recognize these ideas when they return:

- **The course thesis:** Pretty pictures → measurements → models → inferences
- **The four observables:** Brightness, position, wavelength, timing
- **The spoiler pattern:** Observable → Model → Physical Reality
- **Lookback time:** Looking far away = looking into the past
- **Wavelength:** Encodes temperature, composition, and motion

39–40 min. Read the list once, then say: "Recognition, not mastery."

## Recognition, Not Retention {background-image="/assets/images/common/eso-milky-way-panoramic.jpg" background-opacity="0.25"}

::: {.bg-muted .p-2 .text-center}

::: {.text-lg .font-semibold .mt-0}
You are not expected to remember details yet.

::: {.text-base .mt-2}
Today was a **trailer** — a preview of coming attractions.
:::

::: {.text-base .font-semibold .mt-2}
When these ideas return, you'll recognize them. That's the goal.
:::

:::

::: {.notes}
40–41 min.

**EXACT SCRIPT:**

"If this felt overwhelming at moments, that's a sign this worked. You are not expected to remember details yet. You are expected to recognize ideas when we return to them — and by the end of the semester, you'll be able to say these things with confidence."

## Questions We'll Answer This Semester {background-image="/assets/images/common/cosmic-cliffs-jwst.png" background-opacity="0.3"}

::: {.bg-muted .p-2}

- How do we know the Sun's temperature if we can't touch it?
- How do we weigh a star?
- How do we know the universe is 13.8 billion years old?
- What IS dark matter?
- How do we search for life on other planets?

:::

::: {.fragment .text-center .text-base .font-semibold .mt-4}
**Write down YOUR question. We'll return to it.**
:::

::: {.notes}
41–42 min.

Give students a moment to write their own question.

"Keep your question somewhere. We'll come back to it during the semester."

## Next Time: Math Boot Camp {background-image="/assets/images/module-01/math-toolbox-nblm.webp" background-opacity="0.2"}

**Thursday: The Math We Need**

::: {.incremental}
- Scientific notation (writing very big and very small numbers)
- Powers of 10 and orders of magnitude
- Ratio reasoning ("if X doubles, what happens to Y?")
- Dimensional analysis (do the units make sense?)
:::

::: {.fragment}
::: {.text-center .text-lg .font-semibold .mt-2}
The math is not the obstacle — it's the microscope.
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
42–43 min.

"Don't worry if math isn't your favorite subject. The math we use is a tool for seeing clearly, not a barrier to understanding."

Emphasize: "If you can do ratios and powers of 10, you can do the math in this course."

## Questions? {background-image="/assets/images/common/noirlab-nightsky-mosaic.jpg" background-opacity="0.4"}

::: {.notes}
Leave remaining time for questions about the big picture.

Good closing: "Welcome to ASTR 101. Let's decode the cosmos together."

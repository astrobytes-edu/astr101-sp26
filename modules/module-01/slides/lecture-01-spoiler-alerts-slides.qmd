**By the end of today, you can…**

- State the course thesis: **pretty pictures → measurements → models → inferences**
- Name the 4 direct observables: **brightness, position, wavelength, timing**
- Explain why light matters: **wavelength** + **lookback time**

::: notes
Don’t read the small text on this infographic. It’s a **map**, not a quiz.

Point once to each region (quick tour):

1) **Left: “The Inference Pipeline”**
   - These are the only four kinds of things we can directly measure from far away:
     **brightness**, **position**, **wavelength**, **timing**.
   - Everything else we talk about in astronomy is built from these + physics.

2) **Middle: the telescope**
   - Telescopes don’t “take pictures” the way your phone does.
   - They collect **photons** and turn them into numbers: counts, angles, spectra, time series.

3) **Right: “The Decoder Ring”**
   - The decoder ring is the move we repeat all semester:
     **signal → measurement → model → inference**.
   - The key promise of the course: we’ll make the “model” step explicit, so you can see what assumptions are being made.

4) **Bottom: two ideas to tag for later**
   - **Wavelength is physics**: different wavelengths show different temperatures/processes.
   - **Distance is a time dial**: because light takes time to travel, looking farther means looking farther into the past.

Close the slide with:
“Today is just the trailer. If you recognize these ingredients when they show up later, you’re doing it right.”

Keep it tight.

“None of those came from direct contact: no thermometers in stars, no tape measures to galaxies.”

## The Four Things We Can Actually Measure (Directly) {background-color="black"}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
{{< img four-observables class="img-center" >}}
:::
::: {.column width="40%"}

**Direct observables (inputs):**

::: {.incremental}
- **Brightness** (flux)
- **Position** (angles + changes)
- **Wavelength** (spectrum/color)
- **Timing** (variability)
:::

::: {.text-sm .text-muted .mt-2}
Everything else is inferred using physics.
:::
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
4–6 min.

These four are the only “inputs” the universe gives us.

Don’t over-explain yet—just name them and point to each icon in the figure.

If you want a one-liner to land: “Everything else we care about is a calculation.”
:::

---

## Models Are the Bridge (“Decoder Ring”) {background-color="black"}

::: {.text-center .text-base .text-muted .mt-0}
Pretty pictures → measurements → **models** → inferences
:::

:::: {.columns .mt-2}
::: {.column width="45%"}
**What we can directly measure:**

- **Brightness** (flux)
- **Position** (angles + changes)
- **Wavelength** (spectrum/color)
- **Timing** (variability)
:::
::: {.column width="55%"}
**What a model does:**

- A **model** is a mathematical relationship that encodes physical assumptions.
- It’s the “decoder ring” that turns an observable into a physical claim.

::: {.text-sm .text-muted .mt-2}
Without models, astronomy is just a catalog of points of light.
:::
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
6–7 min.

Say explicitly: “An inference is only as strong as the model that connects what we measured to what we’re claiming.”

Concrete anchor (optional, don’t derive): the inverse-square law connects measured flux to luminosity and distance:
$F = L/(4\\pi d^2)$.
:::

---

## Prediction: How Do We Know the Sun’s Temperature? {background-color="black"}

The Sun’s surface temperature is about **5,800 K**.

Based on the “four observables,” how did astronomers figure this out?

::: {.bg-muted .p-2}
**Commit to one answer before we move on:**

- A) Sent a thermometer on a spacecraft
- B) Measured the wavelength/spectrum of sunlight
- C) Calculated from the Sun’s size and distance
- D) Estimated based on “how hot it looks”
:::

::: {.notes}
~7–8 min. Give ~45 seconds. **Don’t reveal yet.**

Prompt: “Temperature is not one of the four observables. So which observable could possibly connect to temperature?”
:::

---

## Prediction Reveal: Temperature Is Inferred from Spectrum {background-color="black"}

::: {.bg-muted .p-2}
- **Measure:** the spectrum/color of sunlight (brightness vs. wavelength)
- **Infer:** the Sun’s surface temperature (~5,800 K)
- **Physics:** blackbody/Wien-type models connect peak wavelength to temperature
:::

::: {.text-sm .text-muted}
Temperature is **never** directly measured.
:::

::: {.notes}
~8–9 min.

Land the punchline: “We didn’t stick a thermometer in the Sun. We measured *wavelength* and used physics to infer temperature.”

If you want one sentence to repeat all semester: “Observable → model → inference.”
:::

---

## The Six Core Quantities We Infer {background-color="black"}

::: {.table-scroll .text-sm}
| What we infer | We measure | Model “bridge” (examples) |
|---|---|---|
| **Distance** | brightness **or** position | inverse-square law **or** parallax geometry |
| **Time** | timing **or** distance | lookback time; evolution/expansion models |
| **Speed** | wavelength (shifts) | Doppler effect |
| **Mass** | position + timing (orbits) | gravity/orbital dynamics |
| **Luminosity (energy output)** | brightness + distance | $L = 4\\pi d^2 F$ |
| **Temperature** | wavelength (spectrum/color) | blackbody/Wien-type models |
:::

::: {.text-sm .text-muted}
None of these are direct observables. Every one is inferred.
:::

::: {.notes}
~9–10 min.

Don’t ask them to memorize this today. Use it as a promise: “Every tool we learn this semester is a new, better bridge from the four observables to these quantities.”

If students ask about composition: acknowledge it’s also inferred from wavelength (spectral lines), but today’s “six” list is the course’s core quantity set.
:::

---

## Quick Check: What Can We Measure Directly? {background-color="#1a1a2e"}

::: {.quiz}
Which can astronomers *directly* measure for a distant star?

- [ ] Temperature
- [x] Apparent brightness
- [ ] Mass
- [ ] Age
:::

::: {.notes}
7–8 min.

Give ~20–30 seconds: “Don’t overthink—what can we measure *directly*?”

Then confirm: **apparent brightness** is a direct measurement; temperature/mass/age are inferences.
:::

---

## Quick Check: The Six Quantities {background-color="#1a1a2e"}

::: {.quiz}
Which list correctly names the six core physical quantities astronomers infer?

- [ ] brightness, position, wavelength, timing, mass, age
- [x] distance, time, speed, mass, luminosity, temperature
- [ ] distance, speed, mass, luminosity, temperature, composition
- [ ] flux, position, spectrum, timing, energy, density
:::

::: {.notes}
~10–11 min. Give ~30 seconds.

Correct: distance, time, speed, mass, luminosity, temperature.

If they ask about composition: it’s a major application of spectroscopy, but it is not part of the “six core quantities” list for this lecture’s LO.

8–9 min. **HR Diagram construction from Omega Centauri.**

Watch what happens when astronomers sort stars by two observables: brightness and color. A pattern emerges.

The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram is one of astronomy's greatest tools—and it's built entirely from *things we can measure*. No magic. Just careful observation and pattern recognition.

**Key message:** Astronomers are pattern hunters. Sort the data, find the structure, discover the physics.

:::
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
10–12 min.

**Measure:** colors at specific wavelengths (e.g., red Hα; blue-green [OIII]).

**Infer:** hydrogen vs oxygen emission; dark lanes = dust blocking light.

**Physics:** atomic physics: discrete transitions → discrete wavelengths.

**Key insight:** Color isn't decoration—it's encoded physics.

11–13 min. **Trifid and Lagoon Nebulae from Rubin Observatory.**

Made from 678 exposures in just over seven hours. Point out:

- **Rich reds and pinks** = hydrogen-alpha emission (656 nm) — active star formation
- **Blue and turquoise** = reflected starlight and glowing oxygen ([OIII], 495–501 nm)
- **Dark lanes and golden clouds** = dense dust absorbing visible light

This is exactly what we just discussed: color = physics.
:::

---

## Quick Check: Why Specific Colors? {background-color="#1a1a2e"}

::: {.quiz}
Why do nebulae glow at *specific* colors?

- [ ] Telescopes filter other colors
- [x] Each element emits at specific wavelengths
- [ ] Hot gas always glows red
- [ ] Colors are added artificially
:::

::: {.notes}
11–12 min.

Correct: each element has a unique set of wavelengths it can emit/absorb (a spectral fingerprint).

- **Infer:** distance far beyond geometry alone
- **Physics:** inverse-square law + standard candles
- **Why it matters later:** most cosmic distances rely on this ladder chain
:::
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
12–14 min.

**Measure:** apparent brightness (flux) of objects whose true luminosity we can determine (“standard candles”).

**Infer:** distances much farther than parallax can reach.

**Physics:** inverse-square law: $F = L / (4\\pi d^2)$.

**Key insight:** Distance is inferred from brightness.

{{< media rr-lyrae-rubin width="100%" height="100%" >}}
:::

::: {.notes}
15–17 min. **46 pulsating RR Lyrae stars from Rubin Observatory.**

Watch the stars pulse. RR Lyrae are **standard candles** — their pulsation period tells us their intrinsic luminosity.

Over the next 10 years, Rubin will detect up to 100,000 of these stars extending more than a million light-years away, mapping the outer reaches of our Galaxy.

**This is the cosmic distance ladder in action.** Measure how bright they appear, know how bright they are, calculate how far.

- **Physics:** nuclear reactions have specific products
- **Why it matters later:** “starstuff” is an inference we can test with spectra
:::
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
15–17 min.

**Measure:** Spectral fingerprints.

**Infer:** The periodic table is a fossil record of cosmic processes.

**Physics:** Nuclear reactions have specific products.

**Key insight:** Stars don't just shine—they manufacture atoms. You are starstuff.
:::

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
{{< img prism-spectrum class="img-center" >}}

- **Why it matters later:** spectroscopy is the “master key” we’ll keep using
:::
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
17–19 min.

**CRITICAL SLIDE — EXACT SCRIPT:**

"This slide is one of the most important in the entire course. Spectroscopy is how astronomy stops being pictures and starts being physics. If one idea from today sticks, let it be this one."
:::

---

## Spectroscopy: A Quantum Barcode {background-color="black"}

{{< img quantum-barcode >}}

::: {.notes}
19–21 min.

**Measure:** Brightness vs. wavelength.

**Infer:** Temperature, composition, velocity.

**Physics:** Atoms have quantized energy levels. Electron jumps → photons at exact wavelengths.

A prism transforms one brightness into thousands of data points.
:::

---

## Quick Check: What Does “Temperature” Really Come From? {background-color="#1a1a2e"}

::: {.quiz}
A headline says: “Scientists measure the temperature of a distant star.”

What did they most directly measure?

- [ ] Brightness
- [ ] Position
- [x] Wavelength (spectrum/color)
- [ ] Timing
:::

::: notes
~1 min.

Now this is fair: we’ve introduced spectra as “brightness vs wavelength.”

Land: temperature is an inference; wavelength/spectrum is the measurement channel that carries temperature information.
:::

---

## Think–Pair–Share {background-image="/assets/images/module-01/prism-spectrum-nblm.png" background-opacity="0.15"}

**Why is spectroscopy the most powerful tool in astronomy?**

::: {.incremental}
1. **Think** (30 s): What does a spectrum reveal that brightness alone cannot?
2. **Pair** (90 s): Discuss with neighbor
3. **Share**: I'll call on pairs
:::

::: {.notes}
21–24 min. Expected answers: reveals temperature, composition, velocity; transforms one measurement into thousands of data points.

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
{{< img em-spectrum-temperature class="img-center" >}}
:::
::: {.column width="40%"}
::: {.bg-muted .p-2}
- **Measure:** photons across many wavelengths
- **Infer:** physical conditions (especially temperature/energy scale)
- **Physics:** photon energy depends on wavelength ($E \\propto 1/\\lambda$)
- **Why it matters later:** different telescopes see different physics, not “better pictures”
:::
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
24–26 min.

**Measure:** Photons across all wavelengths.

**Infer:** Different wavelengths = different temperatures.

**Physics:** Hotter → shorter wavelength.

**Key insight:** The EM spectrum is a temperature ladder.
:::

---

## Prediction: Same Galaxy, Different Wavelength {background-color="black"}

You’re about to see the Whirlpool Galaxy (M51) at two wavelengths: **visible light** and **radio (21-cm)**.

::: {.bg-muted .p-2}
**Prediction:** Will the two images look the same?

- [ ] Yes — same galaxy, same appearance
- [ ] No — they’ll show different structures
:::

::: {.notes}
~26 min. Give ~30 seconds to commit.

Prompt: “Same object, two wavelengths. Do you expect the same structures to light up?”

Advance immediately to the reveal slide.

- **Measure:** optical starlight vs. 21-cm radio emission
- **Infer:** stars and cold gas live in different places
- **Physics:** different emission mechanisms dominate at different wavelengths
- **Why it matters later:** “same object” can mean many different datasets
:::
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
26–28 min.

If you predicted “No,” you were right: the two images emphasize different physical components.

Left (optical): Stars and dust lanes.
Right (radio/21-cm): Cold neutral hydrogen gas.

**Key insight:** Same object + different wavelength = different component visible.
:::

- **Physics:** dust blocks/scatters short wavelengths more than long wavelengths
- **Why it matters later:** infrared is a star-formation detector
:::
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
28–30 min.

::: {.bg-muted .p-2}
- **Measure:** the Crab Nebula at multiple wavelengths
- **Infer:** multiple components coexist (gas, dust, magnetic fields, hot plasma)
- **Physics:** different wavelengths trace different emission mechanisms
- **Why it matters later:** we need multi-wavelength “cross-checks,” not single pictures
:::
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
30–32 min.

- Radio = magnetic fields
- Infrared = warm dust
- Optical = ionized gas from 1054 CE supernova
- X-ray = hot plasma and pulsar jets

**Key insight:** Only by combining wavelengths do we understand complex systems.

{{< img desi-3d-map class="img-center" >}}
:::
::: {.column width="40%"}
::: {.bg-muted .p-2}
- **Measure:** velocities (from Doppler shifts)
- **Infer:** galaxies need more mass than we can see → dark matter
- **Physics:** gravity links orbital speed to mass ($v^2 = GM/r$)
- **Why it matters later:** the “missing mass” problem shapes modern cosmology
:::
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
32–34 min.

Point first to: the filaments, then the voids.

**Measure:** Velocities via Doppler shifts (spectral lines shift → speeds).

**Infer:** There must be more mass than we can see (dark matter). In galaxies, rotation curves imply ~5–6× more mass than visible matter. At the largest scales, the cosmic web’s structure also points to invisible mass shaping gravity.

**Physics:** $v^2 = GM/r$. Measure $v$ and $r$, solve for $M$.

**Cosmic recipe (today):** 5% atoms • 27% dark matter • 68% dark energy.

**Key insight:** We don’t know what most of the universe is made of.

**Measure:** Supernova brightness + redshift.

**Infer:** Universe is 13.8 Gyr old. Expansion is accelerating.

**EXACT SCRIPT:**

"This result was not predicted. The universe did something we didn't expect, and cosmology had to revise its models. That's not a failure of science — that's how science works."

::: {.notes}
40–41 min. **SYNTHESIS MOMENT**

Ask: “Which of the four observables kept showing up?” → **Wavelength** (spectrum).

Bridge: “Spectroscopy is the workhorse of astronomy. Now let’s connect two spoilers using one wavelength idea: Doppler shifts.”

"The Doppler effect is hard. Many students try to avoid it. Don't. This single idea powers huge parts of astronomy — dark matter, galaxy motion, and the expansion of the universe. You do not need to understand it today. You do need to recognize that it matters."

Point first to “now,” then walk outward (Moon → Sun → Andromeda → distant galaxies).

## Quick Check: Lookback Time {background-color="#1a1a2e"}

::: {.quiz}
You observe a galaxy **100 million light-years** away.

When did the light you’re seeing *leave* that galaxy?

- [x] 100 million years ago
- [ ] Right now
- [ ] 13.8 billion years ago
- [ ] It depends on the telescope
:::

::: {.notes}
~46 min. Give ~30 seconds.

Correct: 100 million light-years means the light traveled for 100 million years.

## Orientation: The Wave Relation {background-image="/assets/images/module-01/em-spectrum-nblm.png" background-opacity="0.2"}

$$c = \lambda \nu$$

::: {.incremental}
- $c$ = speed of light (constant)
- $\lambda$ = wavelength
- $\nu$ = frequency
:::

::: {.notes}
~47 min. **EXACT SCRIPT:**

"When you see equations today, I'm not asking you to use them yet. Some equations are here just to show relationships. Others become tools later. Today, you're just learning what exists — not how to wield it."

**Orientation note (for reference):** Units check: wavelength (cm) × frequency (1/s) = cm/s = speed ✓. Longer wavelength ↔ lower frequency (inverse relationship). We'll scaffold this fully in the Light & Spectra lectures.

::::

::: {.notes}
~48 min. **THE PUNCHLINE:**

This is why different wavelengths reveal different physics. It takes hot, violent processes to produce high-energy (short-wavelength) photons.

- Radio photons: cold gas, magnetic fields
- Visible photons: stellar surfaces (~5000 K)
- X-ray photons: million-degree plasma, black hole accretion

**Key insight:** The EM spectrum isn't arbitrary—it's a temperature/energy ladder organized by physics.

## Prediction: X-ray vs. Radio Energy {background-color="black"}

Compare: an X-ray photon ($\\lambda \\approx 1\\ \\text{nm}$) vs. a radio photon ($\\lambda \\approx 1\\ \\text{m}$).

::: {.quiz}
How much more energy does the X-ray have?

- [ ] $10^5$ times more
- [x] $10^9$ times more
- [ ] $10^{-9}$ times more (less energy)
:::

::: {.notes}
~49 min. Give ~45 seconds.

Ratio reasoning: since $E \\propto 1/\\lambda$, the energy ratio is the inverse wavelength ratio:
$1\\ \\text{m} / 1\\ \\text{nm} = 10^9$.

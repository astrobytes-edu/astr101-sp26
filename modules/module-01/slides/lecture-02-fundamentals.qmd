## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

::: {.incremental}
- Use dimensional analysis to verify equation validity
- Apply the ratio method to compare astronomical quantities
- Convert between SI and CGS unit systems
- Perform order-of-magnitude estimations
:::

::: {.notes}
Read these aloud. Students should write them down or note them.

::: {.r-fit-text}
Every physics mistake leaves a fingerprint.
:::

::: {.notes}
0–1 min. Let this sit for 5 seconds. Don't explain yet. Build curiosity. This is your hook.
:::

---

## Spot the Problem

A student calculates the orbital period of Mars using:

$$P = \frac{r^2}{GM}$$

Their answer: $P = 3.5 \times 10^{14}$ ... something.

. . .

**Before you calculate anything:**

Can you tell this equation is *wrong*?

::: {.notes}
1–2 min. Give students 30 seconds to think. The "something" is intentional—they don't know what units the answer should have. That's the point. Don't reveal yet.
:::

---

## The Fingerprint

Let's check the dimensions. Period $P$ should be time: [$[T]$]{.text-accent}.

::: {.fragment}
- $r^2$ has dimensions $[L]^2$
- $GM$ has dimensions $[L^3 T^{-2}]$
:::

::: {.fragment}
$$\frac{r^2}{GM} = \frac{[L^2]}{[L^3 T^{-2}]} = [L^{-1} T^2]$$
:::

::: {.fragment .highlight-red}
**That's not time.** It's "time squared per length"—physically meaningless.
:::

::: {.fragment}
The equation is [*guaranteed* wrong]{.text-warning .font-bold}. No calculator needed.
:::

::: {.notes}
2–4 min. Walk through slowly. Key message: dimensions catch errors before you waste time calculating. This is the "smoke detector" in action.
:::

---

## What You'll Do Today

Using only dimensional analysis, you will:

::: {.incremental}
- **Derive** how planets orbit (Kepler's Third Law)
- **Estimate** the size of a black hole's event horizon
- **Explain** why white dwarfs get *smaller* when they gain mass
:::

. . .

No calculus. No memorizing formulas. Just dimensional logic.

::: {.notes}
4–5 min. Build anticipation. These are genuinely surprising results—especially the white dwarf one. Students should feel "I want to know how to do that."
:::

---

## About That "Math Person" Thing

You might be thinking: "I'm not a math person."

. . .

Here's the truth:

::: {.incremental}
- Your brain *physically changes* when you learn hard things
- The discomfort you feel? That's neurons forming new connections
- "Math person" is learned, not born—and it can be unlearned
:::

. . .

This isn't talent. It's a **skill** you're about to learn.

::: {.notes}
5–6 min. Keep brief but sincere. Reference "Why ASTR 201 is Different" if students have read it. The research is real (Moser et al., Woollett & Maguire).
:::

---

## But First: Why Do We Need These Tools?

Stars appear as points of light.

We can't visit them. We can't weigh them.

. . .

**So how do we know anything about them?**

. . .

We need a toolkit that extracts physics from limited data.

::: {.notes}
6–7 min. Transition to the Ambiguity Problem. This bridges the motivation (new) to the framing (existing).
:::

---

## {background-image="/assets/images/common/noirlab-nightsky-mosaic.jpg" background-opacity="0.3"}

::: {.r-fit-text}
The Ambiguity Problem
:::

::: {.notes}
Hook: 0–5 min. Start with mystery, not answers.
:::

---

## Points of Light

When we look at the night sky, stars appear as mere points.

Is that faint red glow...

::: {.incremental}
- A tiny, nearby dwarf?
- A massive, distant supergiant?
:::

. . .

We can't visit them. We can't weigh them directly.

**So how do we know anything about stars?**

::: {.notes}
Build the tension. They have no depth perception. Everything is a 2D projection.
:::

---

## Today's Toolkit

Four methods that turn "points of light" into physics:

::: {.incremental}
1. **Dimensional Analysis** — Is this equation even possible?
2. **The Ratio Method** — How does this compare to something known?
3. **Unit Conversions** — What's the numeric value in useful units?
4. **Order-of-Magnitude** — Does this answer make sense?
:::

. . .

These aren't math drills—they're *inference tools*.

::: {.notes}
Frame as empowerment. "You're about to get superpowers."
:::

## Units vs. Dimensions

{{< img units-vs-dimensions >}}

::: {.notes}
5–6 min. Key insight: units are human inventions, dimensions are physical reality.
:::

---

## The Fundamental Trio

Every physical quantity in this course is built from three ingredients:

| Dimension | Symbol | Example (CGS) |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Length | $[L]$ | cm |
| Mass | $[M]$ | g |
| Time | $[T]$ | s |

. . .

[**Units**]{.rn rn-type="box" rn-color="#4ecdc4"} are conventions (cm vs AU).

[**Dimensions**]{.rn rn-type="underline" rn-color="#ff6b6b"} are invariant physical DNA.

::: {.notes}
6–8 min. Emphasize: you can change units, but you can't change what a quantity *is*. Press **R** twice to annotate Units then Dimensions.
:::

---

## Derived Quantities (CGS)

| Quantity | Dimensions | CGS Unit |
|----------|------------|----------|
| Velocity | $[LT^{-1}]$ | cm/s |
| Acceleration | $[LT^{-2}]$ | cm/s$^2$ |
| Force | $[MLT^{-2}]$ | dyne (g cm/s$^2$) |
| Energy | $[ML^2T^{-2}]$ | erg (g cm$^2$/s$^2$) |
| Pressure | $[ML^{-1}T^{-2}]$ | dyne/cm$^2$ |

::: {.notes}
8–9 min. These are recipes. Energy = mass × length² / time².
:::

---

## Building Blocks

{{< img fundamental-dimensions >}}

::: {.notes}
9–10 min. Visual equation builder. Note the sanity check box.
:::

---

## The Smoke Detector Test

If you calculate a star's **mass** and your answer has dimensions of **time**...

::: {.fragment .highlight-red}
**The physics is wrong.**
:::

::: {.fragment}
You don't need a calculator to know something's broken.
:::

::: {.notes}
9–11 min. This catches errors *before* you waste time computing. The red highlight draws attention to the key insight.
:::

---

## Prediction: Dimensions of $G$ {.smaller}

Newton's law of gravity: $F = \frac{GMm}{r^2}$

**Before I show you:** What dimensions must $G$ have?

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
A. $[MLT^{-2}]$ (same as force)

B. $[M^{-1}L^3T^{-2}]$
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
C. $[L^3T^{-2}]$

D. $[MT^{-2}]$
:::
::::

::: {.notes}
Give students 30 seconds. Cold-call or use iClicker. Common error: forgetting the inverse mass. Answer is **B**.
:::

---

## Worked Example: What are the dimensions of $G$?

Newton's law of gravity:
$$F = \frac{GMm}{r^2}$$

We know:

- $[F] = [MLT^{-2}]$ (force)
- $[M], [m] = [M]$ (mass)
- $[r] = [L]$ (length)

. . .

Solve for $[G]$:
$$[G] = \frac{[F][r^2]}{[M][m]} = \frac{[MLT^{-2}][L^2]}{[M^2]} = [M^{-1}L^3T^{-2}]$$

::: {.notes}
11–13 min. Walk through cancellation slowly. "G has weird units because gravity is weak."
:::

---

## Constants Are Physical Quantities

{{< img physical-constants >}}

::: {.notes}
13–14 min. Constants are not arbitrary numbers—they're conversion factors built into the universe.
:::

---

## Check Yourself: Orbital Period

Kepler's Third Law gives us:
$$P \propto \sqrt{\frac{r^3}{GM}}$$

. . .

**Question:** Verify the dimensions work out to time $[T]$.

::: {.notes}
14–15 min. Give them 30 seconds to think.

Answer: $[r^3/GM] = [L^3]/[M^{-1}L^3T^{-2}][M] = [L^3]/[L^3T^{-2}] = [T^2]$

Square root gives $[T]$. ✓
:::

---

## But Wait—How Did We *Get* That Formula?

We just **verified** Kepler's Law.

. . .

But can we **derive** it from first principles?

. . .

Yes. Using only dimensional analysis.

---

## The Protocol

{{< img da-protocol >}}

::: {.notes}
16–17 min. This is the recipe. We'll use it repeatedly.
:::

---

## Case Study A: Planetary Orbits

{{< img case-a-orbits-1 >}}

::: {.notes}
17–18 min. Step 1: Identify ingredients and their dimensions.
:::

---

## Recovering Kepler's Third Law

{{< img case-a-orbits-2 >}}

::: {.notes}
18–20 min. Walk through each step. No calculus needed!
:::

---

## Reading the Equation

{{< img case-a-orbits-3 >}}

::: {.notes}
20–21 min. The equation tells a story. Mass in denominator = stronger = faster. Distance in numerator = farther = slower.
:::

---

## Case Study B: Black Hole Event Horizon

{{< img case-b-blackhole-1 >}}

::: {.notes}
21–22 min. Different ingredients: now we need c because nothing escapes.
:::

---

## The Schwarzschild Radius

{{< img case-b-blackhole-2 >}}

::: {.notes}
22–23 min. Einstein's General Relativity gives exactly this scaling. We got it without solving his field equations!
:::

---

## Advanced: White Dwarf Degeneracy Pressure {.smaller}

{{< img case-c-whitedwarf-1 >}}

::: {.notes}
23–24 min. **OPTIONAL** — skip if short on time. When quantum mechanics enters through ℏ. Press → to skip to Tool 2, or continue for the payoff.
:::

---

## The Counter-Intuitive Result {.smaller}

{{< img case-c-whitedwarf-2 >}}

::: {.notes}
24–25 min. **OPTIONAL** — More mass = smaller white dwarf. Counterintuitive but true! This is the "weird radius-mass relation" promised in the intro.
:::

---

## {.center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
Tool 2: The Ratio Method
:::

*Escaping the "big number" trap*

---

## The Problem with Big Numbers

Mass of the Sun: $M_\odot = 2 \times 10^{33}$ g
Mass of the Earth: $M_\oplus = 6 \times 10^{27}$ g

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%" .fragment}
**Subtraction** [fails]{.text-warning}

$$M_\odot - M_\oplus = 1.999... \times 10^{33} \text{ g}$$

Useless. Still a giant, meaningless number.
:::

::: {.column width="50%" .fragment}
**Division** [works]{.text-success}

$$\frac{M_\odot}{M_\oplus} \approx 333{,}000$$

The Sun is **333,000×** more massive than Earth.
:::
::::

::: {.fragment .mt-2}
Ratios give relative scale. Absolute numbers often don't.
:::

::: {.notes}
17–19 min. Key insight: ratios reveal physical relationships that raw numbers hide.
:::

---

## The Cancellation Trick

Most physical laws are proportionality relationships:
$$A = kB^n$$

When comparing two systems:
$$\frac{A_2}{A_1} = \frac{kB_2^n}{kB_1^n} = \left(\frac{B_2}{B_1}\right)^n$$

. . .

**The constant $k$ cancels!**

We don't need to know $G$, $\pi$, or $\sigma$ numerically.

::: {.notes}
19–22 min. This is the key insight. Constants are "nuisances" that vanish in ratios.
:::

---

## Worked Example: Solar Volume

The Sun's radius is 109 times Earth's radius:
$$\frac{R_\odot}{R_\oplus} = 109$$

Volume of a sphere: $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3$

. . .

How many Earths fit inside the Sun?

$$\frac{V_\odot}{V_\oplus} = \left(\frac{R_\odot}{R_\oplus}\right)^3 = 109^3 \approx 1.3 \times 10^6$$

**Over 1 million Earths!**

::: {.notes}
22–25 min. Notice: we never calculated actual volumes in cm³. Ratios are enough.
:::

---

## Scaling Intuition

| Scaling | Physical Meaning | Example |
|---------|------------------|---------|
| $A \propto B^2$ | Area | Surface area, intensity |
| $A \propto B^3$ | Volume | Mass (if density constant) |
| $A \propto B^{-2}$ | Inverse-square | Gravity, light intensity |

. . .

**Small changes in input → big changes in output when $n > 1$**

::: {.notes}
25–27 min. The power tells the physical story.
:::

---

## Concept Check: Surface Area Scaling

If you double a nebula's radius, by what factor does its surface area increase?

::: {.quiz}
Surface area scales as $R^2$. If radius doubles, surface area becomes...

- [ ] 2× (linear scaling)
- [x] 4× (quadratic scaling)
- [ ] 8× (cubic scaling)
- [ ] 16× (quartic scaling)
:::

::: {.notes}
Give students 30 seconds. Press **C** to reveal answer. Common error: choosing A (forgetting the square). Answer is B.
:::

---

## Solution: Surface Area

$$SA \propto R^2$$
$$\frac{SA_2}{SA_1} = \left(\frac{2R}{R}\right)^2 = 4$$

**Factor of 4.** (The $4\pi$ cancels.)

*Why astronomers use CGS*

---

## First: Scientific Notation Crash Course

Numbers in astronomy get... absurd.

. . .

**Mass of the Sun:**
$$1{,}989{,}000{,}000{,}000{,}000{,}000{,}000{,}000{,}000{,}000{,}000 \text{ g}$$

. . .

Nobody writes that. Instead:

$$M_\odot = 2 \times 10^{33} \text{ g}$$

::: {.notes}
25–26 min. This is the language of big (and small) numbers. Essential skill.
:::

---

## Reading Scientific Notation

$$a \times 10^n$$

| Part | What it means |
|------|---------------|
| $a$ | Coefficient (1–10) |
| $10^n$ | "Move decimal $n$ places" |
| $n > 0$ | Big number (move right) |
| $n < 0$ | Small number (move left) |

. . .

**Example:** $3.0 \times 10^{10}$ = 30,000,000,000 = 30 billion

::: {.notes}
26–27 min. The exponent tells you the magnitude. The coefficient is refinement.
:::

---

## Rules of the Game

**Multiplication:** Add exponents
$$10^3 \times 10^5 = 10^{3+5} = 10^8$$

. . .

**Division:** Subtract exponents
$$\frac{10^{33}}{10^{27}} = 10^{33-27} = 10^6$$

. . .

**Powers:** Multiply exponents
$$(10^3)^2 = 10^{3 \times 2} = 10^6$$

::: {.notes}
27–28 min. These rules make astrophysical math manageable.
:::

---

## SI Prefixes: The Language of Scale

| Prefix | Symbol | Power | Example |
|--------|--------|-------|---------|
| tera | T | $10^{12}$ | THz (infrared) |
| giga | G | $10^{9}$ | GHz (radio) |
| mega | M | $10^{6}$ | Mpc (galaxy distances) |
| kilo | k | $10^{3}$ | km (everyday) |
| centi | c | $10^{-2}$ | cm (CGS!) |
| milli | m | $10^{-3}$ | mm (wavelengths) |
| micro | μ | $10^{-6}$ | μm (infrared) |
| nano | n | $10^{-9}$ | nm (visible light) |

::: {.notes}
28–29 min. You already know most of these! Astronomy just uses bigger/smaller ones.
:::

---

## Astronomy Lives at the Extremes

| Scale | Value | Context |
|-------|-------|---------|
| $10^{-13}$ cm | Atomic nucleus | Where fusion happens |
| $10^{-5}$ cm | Wavelength of light | What we detect |
| $10^{10}$ cm | Solar radius | A typical star |
| $10^{18}$ cm | 1 parsec | Distance scale |
| $10^{28}$ cm | Observable universe | Cosmic horizon |

. . .

**That's 41 orders of magnitude.** Scientific notation isn't optional—it's survival.

---

## The CGS System

Astronomy uses **CGS** (centimeter-gram-second), not SI.

| Base | CGS | SI |
|------|-----|---|
| Length | cm | m |
| Mass | g | kg |
| Time | s | s |

. . .

**Derived units:**

- Energy: **erg** (not Joule)
- Force: **dyne** (not Newton)
- Luminosity: **erg/s** (not Watt)

::: {.notes}
27–29 min. Historical convention that stuck. Numbers stay more manageable.
:::

---

## Why CGS?

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**SI (Physics textbooks)**

$$L_\odot = 3.8 \times 10^{26} \text{ W}$$
:::

::: {.column width="50%" .fragment}
**CGS (Astrophysics)**

$$L_\odot = 3.8 \times 10^{33} \text{ erg/s}$$
:::
::::

::: {.fragment}
Both are correct. CGS is the community standard for astrophysics.
:::

---

## The Fractional Identity

The key insight: $1 \text{ m} = 100 \text{ cm}$ means:

$$\frac{100 \text{ cm}}{1 \text{ m}} = 1$$

. . .

**Multiplying by 1 doesn't change the physics.**

It only changes how we *write* the number.

::: {.notes}
29–31 min. Treat units like algebraic variables. They cancel.
:::

---

## Example 1: Speed

Earth's orbital speed: 30 km/s

Convert to CGS:

$$30 \frac{\text{km}}{\text{s}} \times \frac{10^3 \text{ m}}{1 \text{ km}} \times \frac{10^2 \text{ cm}}{1 \text{ m}}$$

. . .

$$= 30 \times 10^5 \frac{\text{cm}}{\text{s}} = 3 \times 10^6 \text{ cm/s}$$

::: {.notes}
31–33 min. Walk through unit cancellation explicitly.
:::

---

## Example 2: Energy (Exponents Matter!)

How many erg in 1 Joule?

$$1 \text{ J} = 1 \text{ kg} \cdot \text{m}^2 \cdot \text{s}^{-2}$$

. . .

$$= (10^3 \text{ g})(10^2 \text{ cm})^2 \text{ s}^{-2}$$

$$= 10^3 \times 10^4 \text{ g cm}^2 \text{ s}^{-2} = 10^7 \text{ erg}$$

::: {.notes}
33–35 min. Common mistake: forgetting to square the 100.
:::

---

## Example 3: The Stefan-Boltzmann Constant

SI: $\sigma = 5.67 \times 10^{-8}$ W m$^{-2}$ K$^{-4}$

. . .

Convert to CGS:

- W → erg/s: $\times 10^7$
- m$^{-2}$ → cm$^{-2}$: $\times 10^{-4}$

. . .

$$\sigma = 5.67 \times 10^{-8} \times 10^7 \times 10^{-4} = 5.67 \times 10^{-5} \text{ erg cm}^{-2} \text{ s}^{-1} \text{ K}^{-4}$$

---

## Key Conversions to Memorize

| Quantity | CGS Value |
|----------|-----------|
| 1 parsec | $3.09 \times 10^{18}$ cm |
| 1 AU | $1.50 \times 10^{13}$ cm |
| Solar mass $M_\odot$ | $2.0 \times 10^{33}$ g |
| Solar radius $R_\odot$ | $7.0 \times 10^{10}$ cm |
| Solar luminosity $L_\odot$ | $3.8 \times 10^{33}$ erg/s |

::: {.notes}
37–39 min. Pin these to your brain. You'll use them constantly.

*The power of being "roughly right"*

---

## You Already Do This

"Can I drive there before dinner?"

You estimate:

::: {.incremental}
- Distance: ~50 miles
- Speed: ~50 mph
- Time: ~1 hour
:::

. . .

No calculator needed. **Good enough.**

::: {.notes}
39–41 min. Connect to everyday reasoning. This is natural.
:::

---

## Why It's Essential in Astronomy

Numbers span **40+ orders of magnitude**:

- Nucleus: $10^{-13}$ cm
- Observable universe: $10^{28}$ cm

. . .

Exact precision can *hide* the physics.

**If you're off by a factor of 2, that's a triumph.**

**If you're off by $10^{10}$, something's wrong.**

---

## The "Rule of 3"

When estimating:

::: {.incremental}
- Coefficient $< 3$ → round **down** to 1
- Coefficient $> 3$ → round **up** to 10
:::

. . .

**Example:**

- $2 \times 10^{33}$ → $10^{33}$
- $7 \times 10^{10}$ → $10^{11}$

::: {.notes}
42–44 min. The exponent tells the story. Coefficients are refinement.
:::

---

## The Universe's Phone Number

{{< img universe-phone-number >}}

::: {.notes}
44–46 min. The staircase shows each multiplication factor. The phone number encodes the jumps between scales. Have students write this down—they'll use it as a sanity check all semester.
:::

---

## Cosmic Scales: Powers of 10

{{< img logarithmic-cosmic-scales >}}

::: {.notes}
46–47 min. Another visualization of the same idea. Each step is ×10. Human scale sits in the middle. Point out that we're roughly halfway between nucleus and universe on a log scale.
:::

---

## Reading the Phone Number

**Area Code (555):** Three steps DOWN from human scale

- $10^{-5}$ → cells
- $10^{-5}$ → atoms
- $10^{-5}$ → nucleus

. . .

**Exchange (711):** Solar system

- $10^{7}$ → Earth
- $10^{1}$ → Jupiter
- $10^{1}$ → Sun

---

## Reading the Phone Number (cont.)

**Subscriber (2555):** Cosmos

- $10^{2}$ → 1 AU (Earth-Sun)
- $10^{5}$ → nearest stars (~1 pc)
- $10^{5}$ → Milky Way
- $10^{5}$ → observable universe

. . .

If your calculation gives stellar distance = $10^{11}$ cm...

**That's Sun-sized, not star-distance. Red flag!**

---

## Everyday Example: Piano Tuners in Chicago

How many piano tuners work in Chicago?

::: {.incremental}
- Population: ~3 million → $10^6$
- Pianos per household: ~1/20 → $10^{-1}$
- Tunings per piano per year: ~1
- Tunings per tuner per year: ~500 → $10^3$
:::

. . .

$$\frac{10^6 \times 10^{-1} \times 1}{10^3} = 10^2 \approx 100\text{–}300 \text{ tuners}$$

::: {.notes}
47–49 min. Classic Fermi problem. We got ballpark without exact data.
:::

---

## Prediction: Black Hole Size

**Order of magnitude:** The Schwarzschild radius of a solar-mass black hole is closest to:

A. 1 meter

B. 1 kilometer

C. 100 kilometers

D. 1000 kilometers

::: {.notes}
Give students 30 seconds. Most will guess too large. Emphasize: black holes are *compact*.
:::

---

## Astronomy Example: Schwarzschild Radius

Estimate the radius of a solar-mass black hole:
$$R \approx \frac{GM}{c^2}$$

. . .

Using CGS:

- $G \approx 10^{-7}$ cm$^3$ g$^{-1}$ s$^{-2}$
- $M_\odot \approx 10^{33}$ g
- $c \approx 10^{10}$ cm/s

$$R \approx \frac{10^{-7} \times 10^{33}}{(10^{10})^2} = \frac{10^{26}}{10^{20}} = 10^{6} \text{ cm} = 10 \text{ km}$$

. . .

**Exact answer: 3 km.** We were within a factor of 3. *Success!*

## Preview: Where You'll Use These

::: {.incremental}
- **Module 2:** Stellar distances → ratios everywhere
- **Module 3:** Stellar structure → dimensional scaling
- **Module 4:** Cosmology → OOM across the universe
:::

::: {.fragment .mt-2}
These tools are your [**scientific radar**]{.text-accent} for the rest of the course.

## The Takeaway {.center}

If you forget everything else from today, remember this:

::: {.fragment .fade-up}
::: {.r-fit-text}
**Dimensions are your smoke detector.**
:::
:::

::: {.fragment .mt-2}
Before trusting any equation, check that both sides have the same dimensions.

If they don't match, the physics is [*guaranteed* to be wrong]{.text-warning .font-bold}.

::: {.notes}
48–49 min. This is the core message. Emphasize: dimensional analysis catches errors before they cost you time and points. The fade-up animation and fit-text make this memorable.

## Questions?

Common questions at this point:

::: {.incremental}
- "What counts as showing work on homework?"
- "How strict are you about units?"
- "Do we need to memorize the phone number?"
:::

::: {.notes}
49–50 min. Address these directly. Work = show dimensional analysis. Units = CGS always. Phone number = useful mnemonic, not required.
:::

## Reference Tables

**See the Lecture 2 Reference Handout** for:

- CGS unit conversions
- Fundamental physical constants
- Solar units ($M_\odot$, $R_\odot$, $L_\odot$)
- Key distance scales (AU, pc)
- Dimensional "recipes"

::: {.notes}
Direct students to the handout. They should keep it handy for homework.

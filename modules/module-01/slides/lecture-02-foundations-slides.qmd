## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, you will be able to:

::: {.incremental}

- Read and **calculate with scientific notation** (powers of ten)
- Use **SI prefixes** (kilo-, mega-, micro-, …) to translate scale
- Set up **unit conversions** so units cancel (factor-label method)
- Use the **ratio method** to compare planets/stars without big-number pain
- Solve simple **rate problems** (distance = speed × time; amount = rate × time)
- Use the astronomy “distance ladder” units: **AU, light-year, parsec**
:::

::: {.notes}
Set the tone: “This is not a math test. It’s a navigation toolkit for the universe.”

If the Sun were a grapefruit in San Francisco...

...Earth would be a **pinhead** 15 meters away.

The nearest star? Another grapefruit **in Hawaii**.
:::

::: {.notes}
0–1 min. Pause after the first line. Let them picture it. Then reveal the fragments.
This establishes *why* we need powers of ten—ordinary language can't hold these scales.
:::

## Why we’re doing this

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}

### Math as a telescope 🔭

In ASTR 101, numbers aren’t decoration—they’re how we turn **points of light** into **physical reality**.
:::

::: {.incremental}

- Units keep your equations honest.
- Ratios cancel constants and reveal relationships.
- Rates connect motion, time, and change.
- Powers of ten let your brain hold the cosmos.
:::

---

## Today’s Toolkit

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}

### Four survival tools 🧰

:::

::: {.incremental}

1. **Scientific notation + prefixes** → speak “cosmic scale”
2. **Units + conversions** → translate cleanly
3. **Ratio method** → compare without drowning in zeros
4. **Rate problems** → connect distance, time, and speed
:::

---

## Cosmic Scales in One Slide

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="58%"}
**A few anchor distances** (order-of-magnitude is enough today):

| Scale             |                     Distance |     Light travel time |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------: | --------------------: |
| Earth–Moon        |    $3.84\times10^8\,\text{m}$ |   $\sim 1.3\,\text{s}$ |
| 1 AU (Earth–Sun)  | $1.50\times10^{11}\,\text{m}$ | $\sim 8.3\,\text{min}$ |
| 1 light-year (ly) | $9.46\times10^{15}\,\text{m}$ |                1 year |
| 1 parsec (pc)     | $3.09\times10^{16}\,\text{m}$ | $\sim 3.26\,\text{yr}$ |

: {.text-sm}
:::

::: {.column width="42%"}
::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}

### The key idea

Distance and time *mix* in astronomy because information travels at a finite speed.

We don’t see things **as they are**.
We see them **as they were**.
:::
:::
:::

::: {.callout-warning appearance="minimal"}
### Common trap
A **light-year** is a *distance*, not a time—even though "year" is in the name.
It's how far light travels in one year: about 9.5 trillion km.
:::

::: {.notes}
Don't over-precision-police here; emphasize *scale literacy*. You can refine numbers later.
:::

---

## The Speed of Light: Nature's Speed Limit

Light is the fastest thing in the universe. Nothing can travel faster.

$$c = 300{,}000\,\text{km/s} = 3 \times 10^8\,\text{m/s}$$

::: {.incremental}
- Light travels **1 meter** in about 3 nanoseconds
- Light crosses **Earth's diameter** in 0.04 seconds
- Light reaches the **Moon** in 1.3 seconds
- Light reaches the **Sun** in 8.3 minutes
:::

::: {.fragment}
::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
This speed limit has a profound consequence: **information takes time to travel**. When you look at something far away, you're seeing it as it *was*, not as it *is*.
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
1.5 min. Build the speed of light from familiar to cosmic scales.
This sets up the key insight: distance = looking back in time.
:::

---

## What a Light-Year Really Means

A **light-year** is a *distance*, not a time—even though "year" is in the name.

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}
It's how far light travels in one year:

$$1\,\text{ly} \approx 9.5 \times 10^{15}\,\text{m}$$

That's about **9.5 trillion kilometers**.
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
### Why use light-years?

"Proxima Centauri is $4 \times 10^{16}$ m away" is painful.

"4.2 light-years" is memorable.
:::
:::
:::

---

## Distance Is a Time Machine

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}
Because light takes time to travel, **looking far away = looking back in time**.

| Object | Distance | You see it as it was... |
|--------|----------|-------------------------|
| Moon | 1.3 light-sec | 1.3 seconds ago |
| Sun | 8.3 light-min | 8.3 minutes ago |
| Proxima Centauri | 4.2 ly | 4.2 years ago |
| Andromeda Galaxy | 2.5 Mly | 2.5 million years ago |
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
::: {.callout-warning appearance="minimal"}
### Mind-bending implication

The further we look, the further back in time we see.

The most distant galaxies show us the universe as it was **billions of years ago**.
:::
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
1.5 min. Let this sink in. Distance is literally a time dial.
This is why these math tools matter: we need them to decode cosmic history.
:::

---

## Why We Need These Tools

These cosmic scales are why we need a **math survival kit**:

::: {.incremental}
- **Scientific notation** — to write $9{,}500{,}000{,}000{,}000{,}000$ m as $9.5 \times 10^{15}$ m
- **Unit conversions** — to translate between meters, km, AU, and light-years
- **Ratios** — to compare without drowning in zeros
- **Rate problems** — to connect distance, speed, and time
:::

::: {.fragment}
::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
These aren't abstract math exercises. They're the tools that let us decode the universe.
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
1 min. This is the "why we're doing this" slide. Connect the motivation to the tools.
:::

---

## The Universe's Phone Number

{{< img universe-phone-number >}}

::: {.notes}
1 min. Walk through a few steps on the ladder. Emphasize: each step is ×10.
The phone number mnemonic: (555)-711-2555 maps the multiplication factors.
:::

---

## 40 Orders of Magnitude

{{< img logarithmic-cosmic-scales >}}

::: {.notes}
1 min. Let the image sink in. From atoms to the observable universe — each tick is ×10.
This is why we need scientific notation: ordinary numbers can't hold this range.
:::

---

## Stop & Solve 0: Light-time intuition {#stop-solve-0}

Light takes about **8.3 minutes** to travel 1 AU.

::: {.incremental}

- How long does it take light to reach us from something at **2 AU**?
- How long from **0.5 AU**?

Tool 1: Scientific Notation
:::

*Because the universe refuses to be written out in longhand*

::: {.notes}
0.5 min. Section transition. Let the tagline land.
:::

---

## Scientific notation = brain-friendly compression

A number written as

$$a\times 10^n$$

means:

::: {.incremental}

- $a$ is the **coefficient** (usually between 1 and 10)
- $10^n$ tells you how many places the decimal moves
- $n$ is the **order of magnitude** (the scale)
:::

::: {.notes}
2 min. Walk through each bullet. Have students repeat: "a is the coefficient, n is the order of magnitude."
Muscle memory matters for notation fluency.
:::

---

## Converting: decimal ↔ scientific notation

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}
**Big number**

$300{,}000{,}000\\,\text{m/s} = 3.0\times10^8\\,\text{m/s}$

**Small number**

$0.000000001\\,\text{s} = 1.0\times10^{-9}\\,\text{s}$
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}

### Direction rule

- $n>0$ → move decimal **right** (bigger)
- $n<0$ → move decimal **left** (smaller)
:::
:::
:::

---

## Operations (no calculator vibe)

::: {.incremental}

- Multiply: $(a\times10^m)(b\times10^n)=(ab)\times10^{m+n}$
- Divide: $\dfrac{a\times10^m}{b\times10^n}=\left(\dfrac{a}{b}\right)\times10^{m-n}$
- Powers: $(a\times10^m)^k = a^k\times10^{mk}$
:::

::: {.notes}
Make them say the rule out loud once. Muscle memory matters.
:::

---

## Quick Check: Scientific Notation {#stop-solve-1 background-color="#1a1a2e"}

::: {.quiz}
What is $(3 \times 10^5)(4 \times 10^3)$?

- [ ] $7 \times 10^8$
- [ ] $12 \times 10^{15}$
- [x] $1.2 \times 10^9$
- [ ] $1.2 \times 10^8$
:::

::: {.notes}
1-2 min. Give them 30 seconds to think.
Rule: multiply coefficients, add exponents. $3 \times 4 = 12$, $5 + 3 = 8$, then normalize.
:::

---

## SI Prefixes: the language of scale

| Prefix | Symbol |    Factor |
| ------ | -----: | --------: |
| tera   |      T | $10^{12}$ |
| giga   |      G |  $10^{9}$ |
| mega   |      M |  $10^{6}$ |
| kilo   |      k |  $10^{3}$ |
| milli  |      m | $10^{-3}$ |
| micro  |  $\mu$ | $10^{-6}$ |
| nano   |      n | $10^{-9}$ |

::: {.notes}
Stress: these are *power-of-ten labels*. They’re not extra information; they are the exponent.
:::

---

## Order-of-magnitude estimation (OoM)

When exact arithmetic is annoying, estimate on purpose.

::: {.incremental}

- Round coefficients to nearby easy numbers.
- For a **rough order-of-magnitude**:
  - coefficient $< 3$ → round to 1
  - coefficient $> 3$ → round to 10
:::

::: {.callout-warning appearance="minimal"}
**OoM is not "sloppy."** It's a controlled approximation for staying in the right cosmic zip code.
:::

---

## {.center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
Tool 2: Units & Conversions
:::

*Units are the meaning of a number*

::: {.notes}
0.5 min. Section transition. Let the tagline land.
:::

---

## What's a Physical Quantity?

A **physical quantity** = a number + a unit

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
### ✓ Physical quantities
- 3 meters
- 5.9 × 10²⁴ kg
- 300,000 km/s
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.callout-warning appearance="minimal"}
### ✗ Not physical quantities
- "3" (three what?)
- "really far"
- "super hot"
:::
:::
:::

::: {.fragment}
**The unit is not optional.** Without it, the number is meaningless.
:::

::: {.notes}
1 min. This seems obvious, but students often drop units mid-calculation.
Emphasize: a number without a unit is like a sentence without a verb.
:::

---

## What's a Physical Constant?

A **physical constant** is a number that nature gives us—it doesn't change.

::: {.incremental}
- **Speed of light:** $c = 3 \times 10^8$ m/s — the universe's speed limit
- **Gravitational constant:** $G = 6.67 \times 10^{-11}$ m³/(kg·s²) — how strong gravity is
- **Planck's constant:** $h = 6.63 \times 10^{-34}$ J·s — the "graininess" of energy
:::

::: {.fragment}
::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
### Why do constants matter?

They're **conversion factors** between different physical quantities. The speed of light $c$ converts between distance and time. That's why light-years work!
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
1.5 min. Don't dwell on the numbers—emphasize the *concept*.
Constants are nature's rules, not human choices. We discover them, we don't invent them.
:::

---

## Units vs. Dimensions (very light intro)

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}
**Units** are human choices:

- meters vs kilometers vs AU

**Dimensions** are the *type* of quantity:

- length $[L]$, time $[T]$, mass $[M]$

Examples:

- speed: $[L/T]$
- area: $[L^2]$
- volume: $[L^3]$
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
{{< img units-vs-dimensions >}}
:::
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
### Why mention dimensions?

Not to do a full "dimension analysis" unit…but because **unit mistakes are the #1 avoidable error** in astronomy problems.
:::

---

## Conversion factors = "multiply by 1"

A conversion factor is an equality written as a fraction.

Example:

$$1\,\text{m} \leftrightarrow 100\,\text{cm}$$

so you can use

$$\frac{100\,\text{cm}}{1\,\text{m}}=1 \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{1\,\text{m}}{100\,\text{cm}}=1.$$

::: {.notes}
1 min. Emphasize: conversion factor = 1. You're not changing the quantity, just the label.
This is the key insight for the factor-label method.
:::

---

## The factor-label method (foolproof)

1. Write what you’re given.

2. Multiply by conversion factors arranged so **units cancel**.

3. Check that your final units match what you wanted.

::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}

### Selection rule

Put the unit you want to **remove** in the denominator.
:::

---

## Example: minutes → hours (structure, not memorization)

$$1000\\,\text{min}\times\frac{1\\,\text{hr}}{60\\,\text{min}} = \frac{1000}{60}\\,\text{hr}\approx 16.7\\,\text{hr}$$

::: {.fragment}
**Sanity check:** hours are bigger units than minutes, so the number should get smaller. ✓
:::

---

## Stop & Solve 2: Unit conversion chains {#stop-solve-2}

::: {.incremental}
**A)** Convert $60\,\text{mph}$ to $\text{m/s}$.

**B)** Convert $0.5^\circ$ to arcseconds.

(Use: $1\,\text{mile}=1.6\,\text{km}$, $1\,\text{hr}=3600\,\text{s}$, $1^\circ=60\,\text{arcmin}$, $1\,\text{arcmin}=60\,\text{arcsec}$.)
:::

::: {.fragment .mt-2 .text-sm}
[→ Solution](#solution-2)
:::

---

## Exponents matter in unit conversions

When a unit is squared or cubed, the conversion factor gets squared/cubed too.

Example idea:

$$1\\,\text{m}=100\\,\text{cm}\;\Rightarrow\;1\\,\text{m}^3=(100\\,\text{cm})^3=10^6\\,\text{cm}^3.$$

::: {.notes}
This is a classic student trap. Do this once slowly.
:::

---

## Compound Units: Building Blocks

Physics has only **three base dimensions**: length $[L]$, mass $[M]$, time $[T]$.

Everything else is built from combinations:

::: {.incremental}
- **Velocity** = distance / time → $[L]/[T]$
- **Acceleration** = velocity / time → $[L]/[T^2]$
- **Force** = mass × acceleration → $[M][L]/[T^2]$
:::

::: {.fragment}
::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
### The building principle
Complex quantities are just base dimensions multiplied and divided. If you know the recipe, you can always check your work.
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
1 min. Walk through how velocity becomes acceleration becomes force.
This is dimensional analysis in miniature—combinations of base units.
:::

---

## Reference: Common Physical Quantities {.smaller}

| Quantity | Dimension | SI Unit | Named Unit |
|----------|-----------|---------|------------|
| Length | $[L]$ | m | meter |
| Mass | $[M]$ | kg | kilogram |
| Time | $[T]$ | s | second |
| Velocity | $[L][T]^{-1}$ | m/s | — |
| Acceleration | $[L][T]^{-2}$ | m/s² | — |
| Force | $[M][L][T]^{-2}$ | kg·m/s² | Newton (N) |
| Energy | $[M][L]^2[T]^{-2}$ | kg·m²/s² | Joule (J) |
| Power | $[M][L]^2[T]^{-3}$ | kg·m²/s³ | Watt (W) |
| Pressure | $[M][L]^{-1}[T]^{-2}$ | kg/(m·s²) | Pascal (Pa) |

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
**Named units are shortcuts.** A Newton is just kg·m/s². A Joule is just kg·m²/s².
If a unit looks unfamiliar, rewrite it in base units!
:::

::: {.notes}
30 sec. Don't memorize this table—use it as a reference.
The point: all units reduce to combinations of length, mass, and time.
:::

---

## {.center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
Tool 3: The Ratio Method
:::

*Compare systems without calculator misery*

::: {.notes}
0.5 min. Section transition. Let the tagline land.
:::

---

## Absolute vs. ratio (why ratios are magic)

Many physics relationships look like

$$A = k B^n$$

Comparing two cases cancels $k$:

$$\frac{A_2}{A_1}=\left(\frac{B_2}{B_1}\right)^n.$$

::: {.fragment}
**What this says:** The ratio tells you how quantities scale—no need to look up constants. If you know how one system behaves, you can predict any other.
:::

---

## Scaling patterns you’ll use all semester

| Scaling         | Meaning                  | Where it shows up                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| $\propto R^2$   | area grows fast          | telescope area, surface area      |
| $\propto R^3$   | volume grows *very* fast | planet volumes, “how many Earths” |
| $\propto 1/r^2$ | inverse-square           | brightness, gravity               |

---

## Quick Check: Volume Ratio {#stop-solve-3 background-color="#1a1a2e"}

The Sun's radius is about 109× Earth's radius. How many Earths fit inside the Sun?

::: {.quiz}
Using $V \propto R^3$, what is $V_\odot / V_\oplus$?

- [ ] About 109
- [ ] About 12,000
- [x] About 1.3 million
- [ ] About 109 million
:::

::: {.notes}
1-2 min. $109^3 \approx 1.3 \times 10^6$.
Key insight: volume grows as the *cube* of radius—much faster than area or length.
:::

---

## Applying the Pattern: Comparing Stars

**What we measure:** Brightness ratio of two stars (same apparent brightness)

**What physics says:** Inverse-square law means equal brightness at different distances implies different luminosities

**What we conclude:** A star 10× further away but equally bright must be **100× more luminous**

::: {.fragment}
::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
### The ratio shortcut
$\frac{L_2}{L_1} = \left(\frac{d_2}{d_1}\right)^2 = 10^2 = 100$
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
1 min. Second use of Observable → Model → Inference.
Ratios + inverse-square = powerful tool for stellar comparison.
:::

---

## Inverse-square intuition (brightness)

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}
If you move twice as far from a light source:

$$\text{brightness}\propto \frac{1}{d^2}$$

$$\frac{B_2}{B_1}=\left(\frac{d_1}{d_2}\right)^2=\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2=\frac{1}{4}$$

**What this says:** Double the distance → brightness drops to 1/4. Triple → 1/9. The falloff is *fast*.
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
{{< img inverse-square-law >}}
:::
:::

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
Astronomers call this brightness measurement **flux** — the energy arriving per second per unit area (W/m²). This is why distance is *hard* in astronomy: small distance errors become big flux errors.
:::

::: {.notes}
2 min. Draw attention to the diagram. Light spreads over area = 4πd².
Double the distance → 4× the area → 1/4 the brightness per unit area.
:::

---

## Applying the Pattern: Distance from Brightness

**What we measure:** Brightness (flux) — how much light arrives at our detector

**What physics says:** Inverse-square law: $F = L / 4\pi d^2$

**What we conclude:** If we know a star's true luminosity $L$ and measure its flux $F$, we can calculate distance $d$

::: {.fragment}
::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
### The inference chain
Observable (flux) → Model (inverse-square) → Physical property (distance)
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
1 min. This is the first explicit use of the Observable → Model → Inference pattern.
Refer back to Lecture 1. We'll use this pattern all semester.
:::

::: {.r-fit-text}
Tool 4: Rate Problems
:::

*Change per time is basically the universe's favorite sentence structure*

::: {.notes}
0.5 min. Section transition. Let the tagline land.
:::

---

## The rate template

Most rate problems are one equation with three rearrangements:

$$\text{amount} = \text{rate}\times\text{time}$$

**What this says:** If you know any two of these, you can find the third. Distance, speed, time — they're all connected.

So:

::: {.incremental}

- $\text{rate}=\dfrac{\text{amount}}{\text{time}}$
- $\text{time}=\dfrac{\text{amount}}{\text{rate}}$
- $\text{amount}=\text{rate}\times\text{time}$
:::

---

## Example: building a light-year (units + rate)

Light speed:

$$c\approx 3\times10^8\text{m/s}$$

Seconds per year:

$$1\,\text{yr}\approx 3.15\times10^7\text{s}$$

So distance in one year:

$$1\,\text{ly}=c\times(1 \text{yr})\approx (3\times10^8)(3.15\times10^7)\text{m}\approx 9.5\times10^{15}\text{m}.$$

::: {.fragment}
::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
### The payoff

Remember: this is why distance = looking back in time. Light from a star 100 light-years away left **100 years ago**.
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
30 sec. Brief callback to the opening motivation. The calculation justifies the concept.
:::

---

## Applying the Pattern: Lookback Time

**What we measure:** Distance to a galaxy (in light-years)

**What physics says:** Light travels at $c = 3 \times 10^8$ m/s (finite speed)

**What we conclude:** A galaxy 2.5 million light-years away → we see it as it was **2.5 million years ago**

::: {.fragment}
::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
Distance is a time machine. The further we look, the further back in time we see.
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
1 min. Third use of Observable → Model → Inference.
Connect to the "distance = time dial" concept from Lecture 1.
:::

---

## Distance Is a Time Dial

{{< img distance-time-dial >}}

::: {.notes}
1 min. Let the visual reinforce the concept. Each distance corresponds to a lookback time.
Moon = 1.3 seconds ago; Sun = 8 minutes ago; Andromeda = 2.5 million years ago.
:::

---

## Stop & Solve 4: Earth's orbital "speed" {#stop-solve-4}

Earth moves around the Sun at about $29.8\,\text{km/s}$.

How far does Earth travel in **one minute**? (Answer in meters.)

---

## Putting it together: a problem-solving checklist

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}

### The decoding ritual

For any quantitative astronomy question:
:::

::: {.incremental}

1. **What am I finding?** (write target with units)
2. **What am I given?** (write givens with units)
3. **Pick the tool:** conversion, ratio, or rate
4. **Do the unit cancellation** (this is your error detector)
5. **Sanity check:** bigger unit → smaller number? right power of ten?

## The Cosmic Distance Ladder

{{< img cosmic-distance-ladder >}}

::: {.notes}
1 min. Preview of coming attractions. Each rung calibrates the next.
We'll explore this in detail in Module 2. For now, just note the pattern.
:::

## What to Take Away

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
### Recognition, not retention

You don't need to memorize formulas. You need to **recognize patterns**:

- Powers of ten compress cosmic scales
- Ratios reveal relationships without constants
- Units keep your equations honest
- Rates connect distance, time, and speed
:::

::: {.fragment}
When you see a big number or a scaling question, you'll know which tool to reach for.

## Solution 0 {#solution-0}

- $2\,\text{AU}$: $2\times 8.3\,\text{min}\approx 16.6\,\text{min}$
- $0.5\,\text{AU}$: $0.5\times 8.3\,\text{min}\approx 4.15\,\text{min}$

## Solution 1 {#solution-1}

1. $(3\times10^5)(4\times10^3) = 12\times10^{8} = 1.2\times10^9$

2. $(8\times10^7)/(2\times10^{12}) = 4\times10^{-5}$

3. $(2\times10^{-4})^3 = 2^3\times10^{-12}=8\times10^{-12}$

## Solution 2 {#solution-2}

### A) $60\,\text{mph} \to \text{m/s}$

$$60,\frac{\text{mile}}{\text{hr}}\times\frac{1.6\,\text{km}}{1\,\text{mile}}\times\frac{1000\,\text{m}}{1\,\text{km}}\times\frac{1\,\text{hr}}{3600\,\text{s}}\approx 26.7\,\text{m/s}$$

### B) $0.5^\circ \to \text{arcsec}$

$$0.5^\circ\times\frac{60\,\text{arcmin}}{1^\circ}\times\frac{60\,\text{arcsec}}{1\,\text{arcmin}}=1800\,\text{arcsec}$$

## Solution 3 {#solution-3}

$$109^3 \approx (1.09\times10^2)^3 = 1.09^3\times10^6\approx 1.3\times10^6.$$

So the Sun's volume is about **1.3 million Earth volumes**.

30 sec. The cube makes a huge difference — radius ratio of 109 becomes volume ratio of 1.3 million.

## Solution 4 {#solution-4}

$$29.8\,\text{km/s} = 2.98\times10^4\,\text{m/s}$$

One minute is $60\,\text{s}$, so

$$\text{distance}=vt=(2.98\times10^4\,\text{m/s})(60\,\text{s})\approx 1.79\times10^6\,\text{m}.$$

That's about **1800 km** in one minute.

::: {.notes}
30 sec. Rate × time = distance. Earth covers almost 2000 km every minute — cosmic speeds are fast!

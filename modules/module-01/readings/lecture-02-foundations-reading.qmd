## The Universe Refuses to Be Written in Longhand

If the Sun were a cantaloupe sitting in San Francisco, Earth would be a pinhead 15 meters away. The nearest star? Another cantaloupe **in Hawaii**.

That's the scale problem astronomy faces. The numbers are so large (or so small) that ordinary notation fails. Writing out the mass of the Sun—2,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kg—is tedious, error-prone, and hides the essential information.

This lecture introduces four tools that professional astronomers use every day:

1. **Scientific notation & SI prefixes** — speak "cosmic scale"
2. **Unit conversions** — translate between measurement systems
3. **The ratio method** — compare without drowning in zeros
4. **Rate problems** — connect distance, time, and speed

These aren't abstract math exercises. They're the language physics uses to describe reality.

### The Universe's Phone Number

{{< fig universe-phone-number >}}

::: {.column-margin}
**The mnemonic:** (555)-711-2555 encodes the scale jumps from human to cosmos. Each digit tells you the power of ten between landmarks.
:::

Here's a mnemonic for navigating cosmic scales, using human scale (~1 m) as the starting point:

**Area code (555) — Going small:**
- First 5: → cells (~$10^{-5}$ m)
- Second 5: → atoms (~$10^{-10}$ m)
- Third 5: → nucleus (~$10^{-15}$ m)

**Exchange (711) — Solar system:**
- 7: → Earth radius (~$10^{7}$ m)
- 1: → Jupiter radius (~$10^{8}$ m)
- 1: → Sun radius (~$10^{9}$ m)

**Subscriber (2555) — The cosmos:**
- 2: → Earth-Sun distance, 1 AU (~$10^{11}$ m)
- 5: → nearest stars (~$10^{16}$ m ≈ 1 parsec)
- 5: → Milky Way diameter (~$10^{21}$ m)
- 5: → observable universe (~$10^{26}$ m)

If your calculation gives a stellar distance of $10^{9}$ m, the phone number tells you that's Sun-sized, not star-distance. Immediate red flag!

::: {.callout-tip title="Check Yourself" collapse="true"}
Light takes about 8.3 minutes to travel 1 AU. How long would it take light to reach something at 2 AU? At 0.5 AU?

**Answer:** Light-travel time scales linearly with distance.
- 2 AU: $2 \times 8.3$ min = **16.6 minutes**
- 0.5 AU: $0.5 \times 8.3$ min = **4.15 minutes**
:::

## Tool 1: Scientific Notation & SI Prefixes

### Compressing Cosmic Numbers

Scientific notation writes any number as:

$$a \times 10^n$$

where:
- $a$ is the **coefficient** (usually between 1 and 10)
- $10^n$ is the **power of ten**
- $n$ is the **exponent** (tells you the scale)

**Examples:**
- $300{,}000{,}000$ m/s = $3.0 \times 10^8$ m/s
- $0.000000001$ s = $1.0 \times 10^{-9}$ s

::: {.column-margin}
**Direction rule:**
- $n > 0$ → move decimal right (bigger)
- $n < 0$ → move decimal left (smaller)
:::

### Operations with Powers of Ten

The algebra of exponents makes cosmic calculations manageable:

| Operation | Rule | Example |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Multiply | Add exponents | $10^3 \times 10^5 = 10^{8}$ |
| Divide | Subtract exponents | $10^{33}/10^{27} = 10^{6}$ |
| Powers | Multiply exponents | $(10^3)^2 = 10^{6}$ |

**Full example:**
$(3 \times 10^5)(4 \times 10^3) = (3 \times 4) \times 10^{5+3} = 12 \times 10^8$

But wait—12 isn't between 1 and 10. **Normalize** by rewriting: $12 = 1.2 \times 10^1$

Final answer: $1.2 \times 10^9$

### SI Prefixes: Naming the Scales

SI prefixes attach to units to indicate powers of ten:

| Prefix | Symbol | Factor | Example |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|
| tera | T | $10^{12}$ | THz (far-infrared frequencies) |
| giga | G | $10^{9}$ | GHz (radio astronomy) |
| mega | M | $10^{6}$ | Mpc (megaparsec—galaxy distances) |
| kilo | k | $10^{3}$ | km (planetary scales) |
| | | $10^{0}$ | meter, gram, second (human scale) |
| milli | m | $10^{-3}$ | mm (submillimeter astronomy) |
| micro | μ | $10^{-6}$ | μm (infrared wavelengths) |
| nano | n | $10^{-9}$ | nm (visible light: 400–700 nm) |

**Example:** Visible light spans 400–700 nm. The prefix "nano" ($10^{-9}$) tells you immediately these are very short wavelengths—about 1000× smaller than a human hair.

::: {.callout-tip title="Check Yourself" collapse="true"}
What is $(3 \times 10^5)(4 \times 10^3)$ in proper scientific notation?

**Solution:**
1. Multiply coefficients: $3 \times 4 = 12$
2. Add exponents: $10^5 \times 10^3 = 10^{8}$
3. Combine: $12 \times 10^8$
4. Normalize: $12 = 1.2 \times 10^1$, so $12 \times 10^8 = 1.2 \times 10^9$

**Answer:** $1.2 \times 10^9$
:::

## Tool 2: Unit Conversions

### Physical Quantities = Number + Unit

A **physical quantity** is a number attached to a unit. The unit carries meaning.

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
**Physical quantities:**
- 3 meters
- $5.9 \times 10^{24}$ kg
- 300,000 km/s
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
**Not physical quantities:**
- "3" (three what?)
- "really far"
- "super hot"
:::
:::

**The unit is not optional.** Without it, the number is meaningless—like a sentence without a verb.

::: {.column-margin}
**Physical constant:** A number that nature gives us—it doesn't change. Examples: speed of light $c$, gravitational constant $G$.
:::

### Conversion Factors = "Multiply by 1"

Since $1 \text{ m} = 100 \text{ cm}$, we can write:

$$\frac{100 \text{ cm}}{1 \text{ m}} = 1 \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{1 \text{ m}}{100 \text{ cm}} = 1$$

Multiplying by 1 doesn't change the physical quantity—it only changes the label.

### The Factor-Label Method

1. Write what you're given (with units)
2. Multiply by conversion factors arranged so **units cancel**
3. Check that final units match what you wanted

**Selection rule:** Put the unit you want to **remove** in the denominator.

**Example: Convert 60 mph to m/s**

$$60 \frac{\text{mile}}{\text{hr}} \times \frac{1.6 \text{ km}}{1 \text{ mile}} \times \frac{1000 \text{ m}}{1 \text{ km}} \times \frac{1 \text{ hr}}{3600 \text{ s}}$$

Watch the units cancel: mile cancels mile, km cancels km, hr cancels hr. What remains is m/s.

$$= \frac{60 \times 1.6 \times 1000}{3600} \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}} = 26.7 \text{ m/s}$$

**Sanity check:** 60 mph is highway speed. 27 m/s is about 30 meters per second—roughly 100 feet per second. That feels right for highway driving.

### Watch the Exponents!

When a unit is squared or cubed, the conversion factor gets that power too.

**The trap:**
$$1 \text{ km}^3 = 1000 \text{ m}^3$$ ❌ **WRONG**

**The right way:**
$$1 \text{ km}^3 = (1 \text{ km})^3 = (1000 \text{ m})^3 = 1000^3 \text{ m}^3 = 10^9 \text{ m}^3$$ ✓

**Pro tip:** Use parentheses: $(1000 \text{ m})^3$, not $1000 \text{ m}^3$.

### Astronomy's Distance Units

Astronomers use specialized distance units because cosmic scales span many orders of magnitude:

| Unit | Definition | Value in meters |
|------|------------|-----------------|
| AU | Earth-Sun distance | $1.50 \times 10^{11}$ m |
| light-year (ly) | Distance light travels in one year | $9.46 \times 10^{15}$ m |
| parsec (pc) | Distance at which 1 AU subtends 1 arcsecond | $3.09 \times 10^{16}$ m ≈ 3.26 ly |

::: {.callout-warning}
A **light-year** is a unit of **distance**, not time—even though "year" is in the name. It's how far light travels in one year.
:::

::: {.callout-tip title="Check Yourself" collapse="true"}
Convert 1 parsec to light-years using the values in the table.

**Solution:**
$$1 \text{ pc} = 3.09 \times 10^{16} \text{ m}$$
$$1 \text{ ly} = 9.46 \times 10^{15} \text{ m}$$

$$1 \text{ pc} \times \frac{1 \text{ ly}}{9.46 \times 10^{15} \text{ m}} = \frac{3.09 \times 10^{16}}{9.46 \times 10^{15}} \text{ ly}$$

$$= \frac{3.09}{9.46} \times 10^{16-15} \text{ ly} = 0.327 \times 10^1 \text{ ly} = 3.27 \text{ ly}$$

**Answer:** 1 parsec ≈ **3.26 light-years**
:::

---

## Tool 3: The Ratio Method

### Escaping the "Big Number" Trap

The mass of the Sun is approximately $2 \times 10^{30}$ kg. The mass of Earth is roughly $6 \times 10^{24}$ kg. Subtracting them gives a number that's still impossibly large to interpret.

But dividing reveals something meaningful:

$$\frac{M_\odot}{M_\oplus} = \frac{2 \times 10^{30}}{6 \times 10^{24}} = \frac{2}{6} \times 10^{30-24} = 0.33 \times 10^6 \approx 330{,}000$$

The Sun is about **330,000 times more massive** than Earth. *Now* we have intuition.

::: {.column-margin}
**Ratio method:** Compare quantities by dividing rather than subtracting. Constants cancel and relative scales become clear.
:::

::: {.callout-check-yourself title="Check Yourself" collapse="true"}
When comparing two astronomical quantities, which approach gives you more useful insight?

- (a) Subtract them to find the difference
- (b) Divide them to find the ratio
- (c) Add them together
- (d) It doesn't matter—both give the same information

**Answer:** **(b) Divide them to find the ratio.** Subtracting cosmic numbers like $2 \times 10^{30} - 6 \times 10^{24}$ still gives an impossibly large number with no intuitive meaning. But the ratio $330,000$ tells you immediately that the Sun is 330,000 times more massive than Earth—that's useful!
:::

### The Cancellation Trick

Most astrophysical laws are proportionality relationships. Consider a general power law:

$$A = k B^n$$

where $k$ is some constant and $n$ is the scaling power. When we compare two systems:

$$\frac{A_2}{A_1} = \frac{k B_2^n}{k B_1^n} = \left(\frac{B_2}{B_1}\right)^n$$

The constant $k$ cancels completely! The relative change depends only on the relative input, raised to power $n$.

### Scaling Patterns

The power $n$ tells the physical story:

| Scaling | Meaning | Examples |
|---------|---------|----------|
| $\propto R^2$ | Area grows with square | Telescope collecting area, surface area |
| $\propto R^3$ | Volume grows with cube | Planet volumes, "how many Earths" |
| $\propto 1/r^2$ | Inverse-square falloff | Brightness, gravity, light intensity |

Small changes in input lead to big changes in output when $|n| > 1$.

### Worked Example: Telescope Collecting Area

**Problem:** The Keck telescope has a 10-meter diameter mirror. The Hubble Space Telescope has a 2.4-meter diameter mirror. How much more light can Keck collect?

**Setup:** Light-collecting area scales as $A \propto D^2$ (area of a circle).

**Ratio method:**
$$\frac{A_\text{Keck}}{A_\text{Hubble}} = \left(\frac{D_\text{Keck}}{D_\text{Hubble}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{10}{2.4}\right)^2 \approx (4.2)^2 \approx 17$$

**Answer:** Keck collects about **17× more light** than Hubble.

Notice: We never calculated actual areas in square meters. The ratio method eliminated that need.

### Worked Example: How Many Earths Fit in the Sun?

**Problem:** The Sun's radius is about 109× Earth's radius. How many Earths could fit inside the Sun?

**Setup:** Volume scales as $V \propto R^3$.

**Ratio method:**
$$\frac{V_\odot}{V_\oplus} = \left(\frac{R_\odot}{R_\oplus}\right)^3 = (109)^3 \approx 1.3 \times 10^6$$

**Answer:** About **1.3 million Earths** could fit inside the Sun.

The key insight: Radius ratio of 109 becomes volume ratio of 1.3 million. Volume grows fast!

### The Inverse-Square Law

Brightness (flux) follows an inverse-square relationship:

$$\text{brightness} \propto \frac{1}{d^2}$$

If you move twice as far from a light source, brightness drops to **1/4** (not 1/2).

{{< fig inverse-square-law >}}

::: {.column-margin}
**Flux:** Energy per second per area reaching your detector (W/m²). Astronomers use flux and brightness interchangeably in this context.
:::

**Watch the flip!** Because brightness is *inversely* proportional to $d^2$, the distance ratio inverts:

$$\frac{B_2}{B_1} = \left(\frac{d_1}{d_2}\right)^2$$

**Example:** Mars orbits at 1.5 AU. How does sunlight intensity on Mars compare to Earth?

$$\frac{I_\text{Mars}}{I_\text{Earth}} = \left(\frac{d_\text{Earth}}{d_\text{Mars}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{1.5}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9} \approx 0.44$$

Mars receives only **44% as much sunlight** as Earth.

::: {.callout-tip title="Check Yourself" collapse="true"}
The Sun's radius is about 109× Earth's radius. Using $V \propto R^3$, what is $V_\odot / V_\oplus$?

**Answer:** $(109)^3 \approx 1.3 \times 10^6$. The Sun's volume is about **1.3 million** times Earth's volume.
:::

## Tool 4: Rate Problems & Dimensional Reasoning

### The Rate Template

Most rate problems follow one equation with three rearrangements:

$$\text{amount} = \text{rate} \times \text{time}$$

| Find | Formula | Question it answers |
|------|---------|---------------------|
| Rate | $\text{rate} = \frac{\text{amount}}{\text{time}}$ | "How fast?" |
| Time | $\text{time} = \frac{\text{amount}}{\text{rate}}$ | "How long?" |
| Amount | $\text{amount} = \text{rate} \times \text{time}$ | "How much/far?" |

**Astronomy examples:**
- Distance = speed × time
- Energy = power × time
- Mass loss = rate × time

### Worked Example: Building a Light-Year

**Problem:** How far does light travel in one year?

**Step 1: Identify the rate equation**
$$\text{distance} = \text{speed} \times \text{time}$$

**Step 2: Gather values**
- Speed of light: $c = 3 \times 10^8$ m/s
- Time: 1 year

But the units don't match! We need time in seconds.

**Step 3: Convert 1 year to seconds**
$$1 \text{ yr} \times \frac{365 \text{ days}}{1 \text{ yr}} \times \frac{24 \text{ hr}}{1 \text{ day}} \times \frac{3600 \text{ s}}{1 \text{ hr}} \approx 3.15 \times 10^7 \text{ s}$$

**Step 4: Calculate**
$$d = c \times t = (3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s})(3.15 \times 10^7 \text{ s})$$

Multiply coefficients, add exponents:
$$d = (3 \times 3.15) \times 10^{8+7} \text{ m} = 9.45 \times 10^{15} \text{ m}$$

**Answer:** 1 light-year ≈ $9.5 \times 10^{15}$ m (about 9.5 trillion kilometers).

**Unit check:** $\frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}} \times \text{s} = \text{m}$ ✓

### Dimensional Analysis as "Smoke Detector"

Every equation in physics must be dimensionally consistent. If the dimensions on both sides don't match, **the physics is guaranteed to be wrong**—no calculation needed.

**The three fundamental dimensions:**

| Dimension | Symbol | What it represents |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| Length | $[L]$ | Spatial extent |
| Mass | $[M]$ | Amount of matter |
| Time | $[T]$ | Duration |

**Example: Checking velocity**

Velocity has dimensions $[L]/[T]$ (length per time). If an equation claims:

$$v = \frac{d}{t^2}$$

Check the dimensions: $\frac{[L]}{[T]^2} = [L T^{-2}]$

That's acceleration, not velocity! The equation is dimensionally wrong—don't bother calculating.

**The smoke detector principle:** Before plugging in numbers, check that dimensions match your target. Wrong dimensions = guaranteed wrong physics.

::: {.callout-tip title="Check Yourself" collapse="true"}
Earth moves around the Sun at about 29.8 km/s. How far does Earth travel in one minute?

**Solution:**
- Speed: $v = 29.8$ km/s $= 2.98 \times 10^4$ m/s
- Time: $t = 60$ s

$$d = v \times t = (2.98 \times 10^4 \text{ m/s})(60 \text{ s}) = 1.79 \times 10^6 \text{ m}$$

**Answer:** About **1,800 km** in one minute. Earth covers almost 2000 km every minute—cosmic speeds are fast!

## Putting It Together

### The Problem-Solving Checklist

For any quantitative astronomy problem:

1. **What am I finding?** Write the target with units
2. **What am I given?** Write givens with units
3. **Pick the tool:** Conversion, ratio, or rate
4. **Do the calculation:** Make sure units cancel correctly
5. **Sanity check:** Right power of ten? Right direction (bigger/smaller)?

### Recognition, Not Retention

You don't need to memorize formulas. You need to **recognize patterns**:

- Powers of ten compress cosmic scales
- Ratios reveal relationships without messy constants
- Units keep your equations honest
- Rates connect distance, time, and speed

When you see a big number or a scaling question, you'll know which tool to reach for.

::: {.callout-note title="Looking Ahead"}
**Next time:** We'll apply these tools to our first real inference problem—measuring the distance to stars we can never visit.

**Coming soon:** The cosmic distance ladder, parallax, and standard candles. The math toolkit you just learned makes it all possible.

## Scientific Notation & Prefixes

### Problem 1: Express in Scientific Notation

**(a) 4,500,000,000 years (age of the solar system)**

Count decimal places from the first digit to get the exponent:
$$4,500,000,000 = 4.5 \times 10^9 \text{ years}$$

---

**(b) 0.00000000656 m (wavelength of H-alpha)**

Count decimal places moving right to get negative exponent:
$$0.00000000656 = 6.56 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m} = 656 \text{ nm}$$

(This is the famous hydrogen-alpha emission line in the red part of the visible spectrum.)

2. Multiply the exponent by 2: $(10^3)^2 = 10^{6}$
3. Combine: $16 \times 10^6$
4. Normalize: $16 = 1.6 \times 10^1$, so $16 \times 10^6 = 1.6 \times 10^7$

**Answer:** $1.6 \times 10^7$

---

### Problem 3: SI Prefixes

**A radio telescope observes at 1.4 GHz. Express in Hz.**

The prefix "giga" means $10^9$:

**Answer:** $1.4 \times 10^9$ Hz

---

## Unit Conversions

### Problem 4: Speed of Light

**Convert $c = 3 \times 10^8$ m/s to km/hr.**

$$3 \times 10^8 \frac{\text{m}}{\text{s}} \times \frac{1 \text{ km}}{1000 \text{ m}} \times \frac{3600 \text{ s}}{1 \text{ hr}}$$

$$= 3 \times 10^8 \times \frac{3600}{1000} \frac{\text{km}}{\text{hr}} = 3 \times 10^8 \times 3.6 \frac{\text{km}}{\text{hr}}$$

$$= 10.8 \times 10^8 \frac{\text{km}}{\text{hr}} = 1.08 \times 10^9 \frac{\text{km}}{\text{hr}}$$

**Answer:** $c \approx 1.08 \times 10^9$ km/hr (about 1 billion km per hour)

**Unit check:** m/s × (km/m) × (s/hr) = km/hr ✓

---

### Problem 5: Wavelength Conversion

**Red light has wavelength 700 nm. Express in:**

**(a) meters**

$$700 \text{ nm} \times \frac{10^{-9} \text{ m}}{1 \text{ nm}} = 700 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m} = 7.0 \times 10^{-7} \text{ m}$$

---

**(b) micrometers (μm)**

$$700 \text{ nm} \times \frac{1 \text{ μm}}{1000 \text{ nm}} = 0.70 \text{ μm}$$

Or equivalently: $7.0 \times 10^{-7}$ m × $\frac{10^6 \text{ μm}}{1 \text{ m}} = 0.70$ μm

**Answers:** (a) $7.0 \times 10^{-7}$ m, (b) 0.70 μm

---

### Problem 6: Distance to Proxima Centauri

**Proxima Centauri is 4.2 light-years away.**

**(a) Convert to parsecs**

Using 1 pc ≈ 3.26 ly:
$$4.2 \text{ ly} \times \frac{1 \text{ pc}}{3.26 \text{ ly}} = \frac{4.2}{3.26} \text{ pc} \approx 1.29 \text{ pc}$$

---

**(b) Convert to meters**

Using 1 ly = $9.46 \times 10^{15}$ m:
$$4.2 \text{ ly} \times \frac{9.46 \times 10^{15} \text{ m}}{1 \text{ ly}} = 4.2 \times 9.46 \times 10^{15} \text{ m}$$
$$\approx 39.7 \times 10^{15} \text{ m} = 3.97 \times 10^{16} \text{ m}$$

**Answers:** (a) ≈ 1.29 pc, (b) ≈ $4.0 \times 10^{16}$ m

---

## Ratio Method

### Problem 7: Telescope Comparison

**30-meter telescope vs. Hubble (2.4 m). How much more light?**

Light-collecting area scales as $A \propto D^2$:

$$\frac{A_{30\text{m}}}{A_{\text{Hubble}}} = \left(\frac{D_{30\text{m}}}{D_{\text{Hubble}}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{30}{2.4}\right)^2 = (12.5)^2 = 156$$

**Answer:** The 30-meter telescope collects about **156× more light** than Hubble.

---

### Problem 8: Planet Volumes

**Jupiter's radius is 11× Earth's. How many Earths fit inside?**

Volume scales as $V \propto R^3$:

$$\frac{V_\text{Jupiter}}{V_\text{Earth}} = \left(\frac{R_\text{Jupiter}}{R_\text{Earth}}\right)^3 = (11)^3 = 1331$$

**Answer:** About **1,330 Earths** could fit inside Jupiter.

---

### Problem 9: Inverse-Square Brightness

**Star X appears 16× fainter than identical Star Y. How much farther is Star X?**

For identical stars, brightness ratio depends only on distance:
$$\frac{B_X}{B_Y} = \left(\frac{d_Y}{d_X}\right)^2$$

Star X is fainter, so it's farther away. Given $B_X = B_Y / 16$:
$$\frac{1}{16} = \left(\frac{d_Y}{d_X}\right)^2$$

Taking the square root:
$$\frac{d_Y}{d_X} = \frac{1}{4}$$

Therefore:
$$\frac{d_X}{d_Y} = 4$$

**Answer:** Star X is **4× farther away** than Star Y.

**Check:** 4× farther → $4^2 = 16$× dimmer ✓

## Rate Problems

### Problem 10: Light Travel Time to Neptune

**Neptune is 30 AU from the Sun. How long for light to travel?**

**Given:**
- Distance: $d = 30$ AU $= 30 \times 1.50 \times 10^{11}$ m $= 4.5 \times 10^{12}$ m
- Speed of light: $c = 3 \times 10^8$ m/s

**Calculate time:**
$$t = \frac{d}{c} = \frac{4.5 \times 10^{12} \text{ m}}{3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}} = 1.5 \times 10^4 \text{ s} = 15{,}000 \text{ s}$$

**Convert to hours:**
$$15{,}000 \text{ s} \times \frac{1 \text{ hr}}{3600 \text{ s}} \approx 4.2 \text{ hours}$$

**Answer:** About **4.2 hours** (or ~250 minutes)

**Sanity check:** We know light takes ~8 minutes for 1 AU. For 30 AU: $30 \times 8 = 240$ minutes ≈ 4 hours ✓

---

### Problem 11: Earth's Orbital Distance per Day

**Earth moves at 30 km/s. How far in one day?**

**Step 1: Convert speed to useful units**
$$v = 30 \text{ km/s}$$

**Step 2: Calculate distance**
$$d = v \times t = 30 \frac{\text{km}}{\text{s}} \times 1 \text{ day}$$

Convert 1 day to seconds: $1 \text{ day} = 24 \times 3600 = 86{,}400$ s

$$d = 30 \times 86{,}400 \text{ km} = 2.59 \times 10^6 \text{ km}$$

**Step 3: Convert to AU**
$$d = 2.59 \times 10^6 \text{ km} \times \frac{1 \text{ AU}}{1.5 \times 10^8 \text{ km}} \approx 0.017 \text{ AU}$$

**Answer:** Earth travels about **0.017 AU** (or 2.6 million km) per day.

**Check:** Earth's orbit is $2\pi \times 1$ AU ≈ 6.3 AU. Dividing by 365 days gives ~0.017 AU/day ✓

---

### Problem 12: Signal Delay to Mars

**Mars is 1.5 AU from Earth. How long for a radio signal?**

**Given:**
- Distance: $d = 1.5$ AU $= 1.5 \times 1.50 \times 10^{11}$ m $= 2.25 \times 10^{11}$ m
- Speed of light: $c = 3 \times 10^8$ m/s

**Calculate:**
$$t = \frac{d}{c} = \frac{2.25 \times 10^{11} \text{ m}}{3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}} = 7.5 \times 10^2 \text{ s} = 750 \text{ s}$$

**Convert to minutes:**
$$750 \text{ s} \times \frac{1 \text{ min}}{60 \text{ s}} = 12.5 \text{ min}$$

**Answer:** About **12.5 minutes** one-way (so ~25 minutes for a round-trip conversation!)

## Synthesis

### Problem 13: Betelgeuse Supernova

**Betelgeuse is 700 ly away. A supernova occurred in 1300 CE.**

**(a) When will we see it?**

Light from the supernova takes 700 years to reach us:
$$1300 + 700 = 2000 \text{ CE}$$

**Answer:** We would have seen it around **2000 CE** (which means if it happened in 1300, we've already missed it—unless it hasn't happened yet!).

**Note:** This is a trick question. If we haven't seen a supernova from Betelgeuse yet, the explosion hasn't happened within the last 700 years. We can only know about events after their light reaches us.

---

**(b) If we observe the supernova, what is the lookback time?**

Lookback time = time light took to travel from source to us = **700 years**

The explosion happened 700 years before we see it.

---

### Problem 14: Dimensional Check

**Is $v = d \cdot t$ dimensionally correct for velocity?**

**Check dimensions:**
- Left side: Velocity $[v] = [L]/[T] = [LT^{-1}]$
- Right side: $[d \cdot t] = [L] \times [T] = [LT]$

**Compare:**
$$[LT^{-1}] \neq [LT]$$

**Answer:** **No**, the equation is dimensionally incorrect.

- The student wrote multiplication when they should have written division.
- The correct equation is $v = d/t$ (velocity = distance ÷ time)
- Dimensional check of correct equation: $[L]/[T] = [LT^{-1}]$ ✓

**Lesson:** Dimensional analysis catches this error immediately—no calculation needed.

### Problem 15: Why Ratios?

**Question:** The Sun's mass is $2 \times 10^{30}$ kg and Earth's mass is $6 \times 10^{24}$ kg. Why is calculating the *ratio* of these masses more useful than calculating their *difference*?

**Solution:**

**The difference:**
$$M_\odot - M_\oplus = 2 \times 10^{30} - 6 \times 10^{24} \approx 2 \times 10^{30} \text{ kg}$$

This tells us almost nothing useful—the Sun is heavier by "about the Sun's mass." The difference is essentially the larger number, giving no intuitive sense of scale.

**The ratio:**
$$\frac{M_\odot}{M_\oplus} = \frac{2 \times 10^{30}}{6 \times 10^{24}} = \frac{2}{6} \times 10^{6} \approx 333{,}000$$

This tells us the Sun is about **330,000 times more massive** than Earth—an immediately meaningful comparison.

**Why ratios are more useful:**
1. **Human-sized numbers:** Ratios compress cosmic scales into digestible numbers
2. **Intuitive meaning:** "330,000×" is easier to grasp than "$2 \times 10^{30}$ kg"
3. **Constants cancel:** In physics equations, ratios often eliminate unknown constants
4. **Scale-independent:** Ratios work regardless of unit choice

**The takeaway:** When comparing cosmic quantities, always divide—never subtract.

### Problem 16: Sanity Check

**Question:** A student calculates the distance to a nearby star and gets $10^9$ m. Using the "Universe's Phone Number," explain why this answer must be wrong.

**Solution:**

**The Phone Number check:**

The mnemonic (555)-711-2555 tells us:
- $10^9$ m = Sun's radius (the "1" in "711")
- Nearby stars are at ~$10^{16}$ m (the first "5" in "2555")

**The problem:** $10^9$ m is about 1.5 million km—roughly twice the Sun's radius. That's far too small for an interstellar distance!

**What the answer should be:**
- The nearest star (Proxima Centauri) is about 4 light-years ≈ $4 \times 10^{16}$ m
- Any stellar distance should be at least $10^{16}$ m

**The error:** The student's answer is off by a factor of about $10^7$ (ten million). Possible causes:
- Unit conversion error (forgot to convert AU or ly to meters)
- Exponent arithmetic mistake (10^16 ÷ 10^7 = 10^9)
- Used the wrong formula

**Lesson:** The Phone Number mnemonic is a quick sanity check. If your stellar distance is less than $10^{16}$ m, something went wrong.

### The "Impossible" Knowledge Problem

We claim to know real physical things...

- The Sun's surface temperature is about [**5,800 K**]{style="color: #c9a227;"}
- The universe is about [**13.8 billion years**]{style="color: #c9a227;"} old
- You are made of [**stellar debris**]{style="color: #c9a227;"}
:::

::: {style="background: rgba(201, 162, 39, 0.15); padding: 1em; border-left: 4px solid #c9a227; color: #f5f5f0;"}
**But we have never touched the evidence.**

No thermometers in stars. No tape measures to galaxies. We're stuck here, looking at points of light.
:::

::: {.notes}
(8–9 min) Use fragments—build the tension.
Transition question: "So what did we actually measure, and what model makes the inference legitimate?"

:::

. . .

::: {style="margin-top: 1.5em;"}
**Inference** = a conclusion about something we can't directly access, using what we *can* measure + a physical model.

*An inference is not a guess—it's a calculation based on a model.*
:::

::: {.notes}
(9–10 min) This is the most important sentence of the semester.

## Models Are the Bridge ("Decoder Ring")

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
**What we can directly measure:**

- Brightness (flux), Position, Wavelength (spectrum), Timing

**What a model does:**

- A **model** is a mathematical relationship that encodes physical assumptions.
- It's the "decoder ring" that turns an observable into a physical claim.

## Prediction: How Do We Know the Sun's Temperature? {.smaller}

The Sun's surface temperature is about **5,800 K**.

*Based on what you just learned, how do you think astronomers figured this out?*

- [ ] A) Sent a thermometer on a spacecraft
- [ ] B) Measured the wavelength/spectrum of sunlight
- [ ] C) Calculated from the Sun's size and distance
- [ ] D) It's just an estimate based on how hot it looks

::: {.callout-warning appearance="simple"}
**Commit to an answer. We'll check in one slide.**
:::

::: {.notes}
(12–13 min) Give ~45 seconds. Don't reveal yet.
This is a genuine prediction—students have the framework to reason, but haven't seen the answer.
Correct answer: B
:::

::: {style="background: #c9a227; color: #1a1a1a; padding: 0.5em 1.5em; border-radius: 12px; display: inline-block; font-size: 1.5em;"}
The answer is **B**
:::

We measure **wavelength (spectrum)** and use a model (**Wien's law**) to infer temperature.

::: {style="border-left: 4px solid #c9a227; padding-left: 1em; margin-top: 1em;"}
**Temperature is never directly measured.**

The Sun's yellow-white color tells us its peak wavelength → Wien's law converts that to ~5,800 K.
:::
:::

::: {.notes}
(13–14 min) THE REVEAL. "How many of you said B? You're right!"
Key punchline: "Temperature is *not* one of the four observables. We never measure it directly. We infer it."

## The Six Core Quantities We Infer {.smaller}

| What we infer | We measure | Model bridge |
|---------------|------------|--------------|
| **Distance** | brightness (flux) or position | inverse-square law or parallax |
| **Time** | timing or distance | lookback time; evolution models |
| **Speed** | wavelength (spectrum) | Doppler effect |
| **Mass** | position + timing (orbits) | gravity / Kepler's laws |
| **Luminosity** | brightness (flux) + distance | L = 4πd²F |
| **Temperature** | wavelength (spectrum) | blackbody / Wien's law |

::: {style="text-align: center; margin-top: 1em; color: #666; font-style: italic;"}
None of these appear in the "four observables" list. Every one must be inferred.
:::

::: {.notes}

## Quick Check: What Can We Measure Directly?

Which can astronomers *directly* measure for a distant star?

- [ ] A) Temperature
- [x] B) Apparent brightness (flux)
- [ ] C) Mass
- [ ] D) Age

. . .

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
Temperature, mass, and age are all inferred. Only brightness (flux) is directly measured.
:::

::: {.notes}
(15–16 min) Give ~30 seconds.
Correct answer: B (apparent brightness / flux).
LO2 follow-up (ask aloud): "Why *can't* we directly measure a star's temperature?"
:::

---

## Quick Check: The Six Quantities {.smaller}

Which list correctly names the six core physical quantities astronomers infer?

- [ ] A) brightness, position, wavelength, timing, mass, age
- [x] B) distance, time, speed, mass, luminosity, temperature
- [ ] C) distance, speed, mass, luminosity, temperature, composition
- [ ] D) flux, position, spectrum, timing, energy, density

*Hint: Observables are inputs; quantities are outputs.*

::: {.notes}
(16–17 min) Give ~30 seconds.
Correct answer: B
C is wrong because composition is an application of spectroscopy, not one of the six core quantities.
This directly tests LO3.

## Quick Check: Why Specific Colors?

Why do nebulae glow at *specific* colors (like red at 656 nm)?

- [ ] A) Telescopes filter other colors out
- [x] B) Each element emits at specific wavelengths

. . .

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
Each element has a unique spectral fingerprint — colors encode real physics.

## Prediction: X-ray vs. Radio Energy {.smaller}

Compare: An X-ray photon (λ ≈ 1 nm) vs. a radio photon (λ ≈ 1 m).

*Reminder: nm = nanometer, where "nano" = 10⁻⁹ (SI prefix)*

**Prediction:** How much more energy does the X-ray have?

- [ ] A) 10⁵ times more
- [x] B) 10⁹ times more
- [ ] C) 10⁻⁹ times more (less energy)

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
**Use ratio reasoning:** Since E ∝ 1/λ, the ratio of energies equals the inverse ratio of wavelengths.

1 m / 1 nm = 1 m / 10⁻⁹ m = 10⁹

(37–38 min) Give ~45 seconds.
Correct: B. X-rays are a *billion* times more energetic.

## Lookback Time: Distance Is a Time Dial {.smaller}

Because **c** is finite, we see objects as they *were*, not as they *are*.

| Object | You see it as it was... |
|--------|------------------------|
| The Moon | 1.3 seconds ago |
| The Sun | 8.3 minutes ago |
| Andromeda | 2.5 million years ago |
| Distant galaxies | Billions of years ago |

## Quick Check: Lookback Time

You observe a galaxy **100 million light-years** away.

When did the light you're seeing *leave* that galaxy?

- [x] A) 100 million years ago
- [ ] B) Right now
- [ ] C) 13.8 billion years ago
- [ ] D) It depends on the telescope

## What You Can Do Now {.smaller}

After today, you can:

::: {.incremental}
1. **State** the thesis: *pretty pictures → measurements → models → inferences*

2. **Name** the 4 observables: brightness (flux), position, wavelength (spectrum), timing

3. **Name** the 6 quantities: distance, time, speed, mass, luminosity, temperature

4. **Recognize** the Measure → Model → Infer pattern in new examples

5. **Explain** why looking far away means looking into the past
:::

::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
If you can do these at a **recognition** level—not mastery yet—you're exactly where you should be.

## Why this module matters

Before we can understand stars, galaxies, or the universe itself, we need a shared language. This module builds that language: navigating the sky, understanding how gravity shapes orbits, and learning how light carries information across cosmic distances.

Everything in this course rests on the tools you'll master here. By the end of this module, you'll understand how astronomers locate objects, predict motions, and decode the messages hidden in starlight.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Navigate the celestial sphere and locate objects using coordinates
- Explain the causes of Moon phases and eclipses
- Apply Kepler's laws to describe orbital motion
- Describe how light and the electromagnetic spectrum reveal information about distant objects
- Explain how telescopes collect and analyze light

- **What is dark energy?** It makes up ~68% of the universe and drives accelerating expansion, but we don't know what it actually *is*.
- **Why does gravity exist?** We can describe it (Newton, Einstein), but we don't know *why* mass curves spacetime.
- **Is the speed of light truly constant?** Some theories suggest it may have varied in the early universe.

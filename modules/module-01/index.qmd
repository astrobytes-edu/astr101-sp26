## Why this module matters

Before we can understand stars, galaxies, or the universe itself, we need a
shared language. This module builds that language: how to handle astronomical
scales, how gravity shapes orbits, and how light carries information across
cosmic distances.

Everything in this course—every calculation, every inference—rests on the
tools you'll master here. The equations may seem abstract now, but by Week 4,
you'll use them to measure the distances to stars.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Perform dimensional analysis to check equations
- Apply Kepler's laws and derive Newton's law of gravitation
- Explain how blackbody radiation encodes temperature information
- Calculate energy and angular momentum for orbiting bodies

- **What is dark energy?** It makes up ~68% of the universe and drives accelerating expansion, but we don't know what it actually *is*.
- **Why does gravity exist?** We can describe it (Newton, Einstein), but we don't know *why* mass curves spacetime.
- **Is the speed of light truly constant?** Some theories suggest it may have varied in the early universe.

## Why this module matters

Now that you have the foundational tools, we turn to the central question of
observational astronomy: how do we learn about objects we can never touch?
This module shows you how to extract distance, temperature, composition, and
motion from nothing but the light that reaches our telescopes.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Calculate stellar distances using parallax and standard candles
- Interpret stellar spectra to determine temperature and composition
- Apply the H-R diagram to classify stars
- Measure stellar velocities from Doppler shifts

- **What causes the solar abundance problem?** Helioseismology and spectroscopy give different answers for the Sun's composition.
- **Why do stellar models struggle with convection?** We still use mixing-length theory from the 1950s because convection is so hard to model.
- **Are there stars older than the universe?** Some age estimates exceed 13.8 Gyr — systematic errors or new physics?

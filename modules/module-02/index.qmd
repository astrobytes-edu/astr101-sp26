## Why this module matters

Stars are not static points of light—they are dynamic nuclear furnaces held in delicate balance by gravity and pressure. This module takes you inside stars to understand how they generate energy, how we measure their properties, and how they evolve over billions of years.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Explain how the Sun generates energy through nuclear fusion
- Calculate stellar distances using parallax and the H-R diagram
- Describe how binary stars reveal stellar masses
- Trace stellar evolution from birth to death for different mass stars

- **What triggers core-collapse supernovae?** We know massive stars explode, but the exact mechanism is still debated.
- **What is the maximum neutron star mass?** Above ~2-3 M☉ they collapse to black holes, but the exact limit depends on unknown nuclear physics.
- **Why do some massive stars collapse directly to black holes?** The "island of explodability" is not fully understood.

## Why this module matters

We've studied individual stars, but stars are just building blocks. In this final module, we zoom out to the largest scales: the Milky Way, billions of external galaxies, and the universe as a whole. We'll see how galaxy motions reveal dark matter, and how the expansion of space tells us about cosmic origins.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Explain the structure of the Milky Way and evidence for dark matter
- Classify galaxies and describe how we measure their distances
- Apply the Hubble law to describe cosmic expansion
- Describe the Big Bang model and evidence from the cosmic microwave background

::: {.callout-frontier}
- **What is dark matter?** It makes up ~27% of the universe, but we've never detected a dark matter particle directly.
- **Why is there more matter than antimatter?** The Big Bang should have made equal amounts — where did the antimatter go?
- **Is the Hubble tension real?** Local and CMB measurements of H₀ disagree by ~5σ. Systematic error or new physics?

<!---
The life cycles of stars and the nature of their final remains are dictated by a continuous "competition" between the inward pull of **gravity** and the outward pressure generated by **nuclear fusion** or quantum degeneracy.

### **Gravity and Star Formation**
Stellar evolution begins when gravity overcomes internal pressure in a cold, dense **Giant Molecular Cloud (GMC)**. According to the **Jeans criterion**, a cloud must be sufficiently massive and cold for gravity to initiate a collapse. As the cloud contracts, gravity converts gravitational potential energy into heat, a process known as **Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction**. This continues until the core becomes hot enough (approximately 17 million Kelvin) to ignite **nuclear fusion**, establishing a stable state where gas pressure balances the inward pull of gravity.

### **The Main Sequence: A Balanced State**
During the longest phase of a star's life, the **Main Sequence**, the star exists in a state of **hydrostatic equilibrium**. In this state:
*   **Gravity** tries to pull the star's matter toward the center.
*   **Nuclear fusion** in the core provides the outward pressure necessary to support the star’s weight.
*   **Energy Generation**: Low-mass stars like the Sun primarily use the **proton-proton (PP) chain**, while high-mass stars rely on the **CNO cycle**, which is much more sensitive to temperature.
*   **The Virial Theorem**: This physical principle dictates that the thermal energy in the interior must be comparable to the star's gravitational binding energy, linking the core's temperature directly to the star's mass and radius.

### **Post-Main-Sequence Evolution**
When a star exhausts its core hydrogen, gravity causes the inert core to contract, making it even denser and hotter. This higher temperature triggers **shell burning** in the layers surrounding the core, which generates excessive luminosity and forces the outer envelope to expand, turning the star into a **Red Giant**.
*   **Low-Mass Stars**: Eventually ignite helium in a sudden "**Helium flash**" if the core is **electron degenerate**, eventually leaving behind a carbon-oxygen remnant.
*   **High-Mass Stars**: Possess enough gravitational confinement to reach temperatures required to fuse heavier elements up to **Iron**. Because iron fusion requires energy rather than releasing it, the core eventually loses pressure support, leading to a catastrophic **core-collapse supernova**.

### **Stellar Remnants and Gravity's Final State**
The type of remnant left behind depends on whether gravity can be halted by quantum forces after fusion ceases:
*   **White Dwarfs**: For stars with initial masses $< 8M_\odot$, gravity is balanced by **electron degeneracy pressure**. These remnants have a mass limit of **1.4 solar masses (the Chandrasekhar limit)**; exceeding this causes the remnant to collapse further.
*   **Neutron Stars**: For initial masses between $8M_\odot$ and $30M_\odot$, the core collapses until it is balanced by **neutron degeneracy pressure**. They are incredibly dense, with a 10 km radius containing roughly twice the Sun's mass.
*   **Black Holes**: If the remaining core mass exceeds approximately **2.1 solar masses (the TOV limit)**, gravity wins completely. The matter is crushed into a region so small that its escape speed exceeds the speed of light, creating a **black hole** defined by its **Schwarzschild radius**.

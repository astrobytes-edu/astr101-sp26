## Activity Overview

Friday activities are designed for collaborative learning. Students work in small groups while instructors circulate to facilitate discussion.

---

## Current Activities

### Cosmic Distance Builder

**File:** [cosmic-distance-builder.qmd](/activities/cosmic-distance-builder.qmd)

**Duration:** 50 minutes

**Learning objectives:**

- Practice scientific notation conversions
- Build intuition for astronomical scales
- Connect familiar objects to cosmic distances

**Facilitation tips:**

- Circulate during Part 1 to catch notation errors early
- For Part 2, encourage estimation before calculation
- The "surprise" in Part 3 is how tiny the Solar System looks at galactic scales

**Common student struggles:**

- Confusing 10^6 and 10^-6
- Forgetting to convert units before comparing
- Not recognizing when to use small angle formula

## Activity Design Principles

### Structure

Each activity follows a consistent pattern:

1. **Warm-up** (5 min) — Low-stakes entry point
2. **Core exploration** (30 min) — Main concepts, group work
3. **Synthesis** (10 min) — Connect to bigger picture
4. **Extension** (if time) — Challenge problems

### Facilitation Model

- **Don't lecture** — Ask questions that lead students to discover
- **Embrace productive struggle** — Resist giving answers too quickly
- **Target misconceptions** — Know the common wrong answers and why they're wrong
- **Encourage peer teaching** — Students explaining to each other is powerful

### Grading

Activities are graded for completion/effort, not correctness. This encourages risk-taking and authentic struggle.

### Cosmic Distance Builder — Answers

**Part 1: Scientific Notation Practice**
1. 3.84 × 10^8 m
2. 1.5 × 10^11 m
3. 4.2 × 10^16 m

**Part 2: Scale Comparisons**
- Sun-Earth / Earth-Moon ratio: ~390

**Part 3: The Cosmic Zoom-Out**
- Solar System at 1 AU scale: ~40 AU diameter
- At galactic scale: effectively a point

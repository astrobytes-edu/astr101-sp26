## The Challenge

The distance from SDSU to downtown Los Angeles is about **190 km** (120 miles). If your classroom is 12 meters long, what scale would you need to fit that trip inside the room?

$$
\text{Scale} = \frac{190 \text{ km}}{12 \text{ m}} \approx 16 \text{ km per meter}
$$

That's manageable — each meter represents about 16 km.

But what if you wanted to map the **Solar System**? The distance from Earth to the Sun is **$1.5 \times 10^8$ km** (that's 150,000,000 km — we'll learn to write this properly below). That's almost a million times farther than SDSU to LA!

Today, you'll build a *physical* scale model of the Solar System that fits in our available space — and discover why every diagram you've ever seen of the Solar System is lying to you.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this activity, you should be able to:

1. Read and write numbers in **scientific notation** (e.g., $1.5 \times 10^8$ km)
2. Define a **scale** as a ratio and use **unit cancellation** to convert distances
3. Explain why it's impossible to show planet sizes and distances accurately on one model

## Math Background: Units, Scientific Notation, and Proportions

### Why Units Matter

In astronomy (and all science), **units are not optional** — they're part of the answer. "150" is meaningless. "150 km" and "150 million km" are *very* different things.

**Rule:** Always write units with every number. This prevents errors and makes your work checkable.

### Scientific Notation: How Scientists Write Big (and Small) Numbers

Astronomy deals with enormous numbers. Writing "150,000,000 km" is tedious and error-prone (did you count the zeros correctly?). Instead, scientists use **scientific notation**:

$$
1.5 \times 10^8 \text{ km}
$$

This means: $1.5$ multiplied by $10$ eight times, or $1.5 \times 100{,}000{,}000$.

#### How to Read Scientific Notation

The exponent tells you how many places to move the decimal point:

| Scientific Notation | Expanded Form | In Words |
|---------------------|---------------|----------|
| $10^6$ | 1,000,000 | one million |
| $10^7$ | 10,000,000 | ten million |
| $10^8$ | 100,000,000 | one hundred million |
| $10^9$ | 1,000,000,000 | one billion |

#### Converting Between Forms

| In Words | Scientific Notation |
|----------|---------------------|
| 150 million km | $1.5 \times 10^8$ km |
| 50 million km | $5 \times 10^7$ km |
| 10 million km | $1 \times 10^7$ km (or just $10^7$) |
| 1.39 million km | $1.39 \times 10^6$ km |

::: {.callout-note}
## Why Bother?
Scientific notation makes multiplication and division *much* easier. To multiply: add the exponents. To divide: subtract them.

$$
\frac{1.5 \times 10^8}{5 \times 10^7} = \frac{1.5}{5} \times 10^{8-7} = 0.3 \times 10^1 = 0.3 \times 10 = 3
$$

*(The last step: $10^1$ just means $10$, and $0.3 \times 10 = 3$.)*
:::

#### Try It: Scientific Notation Practice

Convert these to scientific notation (answers at bottom of page):

1. 4,500,000 km = $\_\_\_ \times 10^{\_\_}$ km
2. 300,000,000 m/s (speed of light) = $\_\_\_ \times 10^{\_\_}$ m/s

Now try these divisions (subtract exponents!):

3. $\dfrac{3 \times 10^9}{10^6} = \_\_\_ \times 10^{\_\_}$

4. $\dfrac{6 \times 10^{12}}{2 \times 10^4} = \_\_\_ \times 10^{\_\_}$

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Answers
1. $4.5 \times 10^6$ km
2. $3 \times 10^8$ m/s
3. $3 \times 10^{9-6} = 3 \times 10^3 = 3000$
4. $\frac{6}{2} \times 10^{12-4} = 3 \times 10^8$
:::

### Unit Cancellation: Your Best Friend

When you multiply or divide quantities, units cancel just like numbers do. This is called **dimensional analysis**, and it's how scientists check their work.

**The key idea:** Set up your calculation so unwanted units cancel, leaving only the units you want.

**Example:** Convert $1.5 \times 10^8$ km (the Earth-Sun distance) to meters on a map, using the scale "1 m = $5 \times 10^7$ km."

First, rewrite the scale as a **conversion factor** (a fraction equal to 1):

$$
\frac{1 \text{ m}}{5 \times 10^7 \text{ km}} = 1 \quad \text{(because 1 m on the map equals } 5 \times 10^7 \text{ km in reality)}
$$

Now multiply your real distance by this conversion factor:

$$
1.5 \times 10^8 \text{ km} \times \frac{1 \text{ m}}{5 \times 10^7 \text{ km}} = \frac{1.5 \times 10^8}{5 \times 10^7} \text{ m} = \frac{1.5}{5} \times 10^{8-7} \text{ m} = 0.3 \times 10^1 \text{ m} = 3 \text{ m}
$$

**Notice:** The "km" units cancel (one on top, one on bottom), leaving only meters — exactly what we want!

::: {.callout-tip}
## Self-Check: Did Your Units Cancel?
If your answer has weird units like "km²" or "meters per km," something went wrong. Go back and check that units in the numerator cancel with units in the denominator.
:::

### What is a Scale?

A **scale** is a ratio that relates real distances to map distances:

> "1 meter on the map = $5 \times 10^7$ km in reality" (that's 50 million km)

You can write this as a conversion factor in two ways:

- $\dfrac{1 \text{ m}}{5 \times 10^7 \text{ km}}$ — use this to convert **real → map**
- $\dfrac{5 \times 10^7 \text{ km}}{1 \text{ m}}$ — use this to convert **map → real**

Choose whichever version makes the units you don't want cancel out.

### Key Insight: Bigger Scale Number = Smaller Map

This is counterintuitive! If your scale says "1 m = $10^8$ km" instead of "1 m = $5 \times 10^7$ km," your map gets *smaller*, not bigger. Why? Because each meter now represents more real distance, so you need fewer meters total.

| Scale | 1 AU ($1.5 \times 10^8$ km) becomes... |
|-------|----------------------------------------|
| 1 m = $10^7$ km | 15 meters |
| 1 m = $5 \times 10^7$ km | 3 meters |
| 1 m = $10^8$ km | 1.5 meters |

### Quick Reference: The Formula

$$
\text{Map distance} = \text{Real distance} \times \frac{1 \text{ m}}{\text{Scale (in km per m)}}
$$

Or equivalently:

$$
\text{Map distance} = \frac{\text{Real distance}}{\text{Scale}}
$$

**Pro tip:** When dividing in scientific notation, subtract the exponents: $10^8 \div 10^7 = 10^{8-7} = 10^1 = 10$.

## Worked Example: How to Use a Scale

Let's practice with **Scale S2: 1 m = $5 \times 10^7$ km** (that's 50 million km).

**Question:** How far is Earth from the Sun on our map?

**Step 1:** Write down the real distance in scientific notation.
Earth is 1 AU from the Sun. One AU = $1.5 \times 10^8$ km.

**Step 2:** Set up the proportion.
$$
\text{Map distance} = \frac{\text{Real distance}}{\text{Scale}} = \frac{1.5 \times 10^8 \text{ km}}{5 \times 10^7 \text{ km per meter}}
$$

**Step 3:** Calculate (divide the numbers, subtract the exponents).
$$
\text{Map distance} = \frac{1.5}{5} \times 10^{8-7} = 0.3 \times 10^1 = 3 \text{ meters}
$$

**Answer:** At Scale S2, Earth would be placed **3 meters** from the Sun on our map.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Does This Make Sense?
Let's check: 3 meters is about 10 feet — roughly the width of a small room. That seems reasonable for a "walkable" scale model. If you got 3 km or 0.003 m, something went wrong!

## Part A — Choose a Scale That Fits (10 minutes)

You are designing a "Solar System Walkway" that must fit in:

**Available space:** ________ meters *(your instructor will tell you)*

### Step A1: Pick ONE scale

| Scale | 1 meter on the map = | In Words | Notes |
|-------|---------------------|----------|-------|
| **S1** | $10^7$ km | 10 million km | Large map — will it fit? |
| **S2** | $5 \times 10^7$ km | 50 million km | Medium map (recommended) |
| **S3** | $10^8$ km | 100 million km | Compact map |
| **S4** | _________ km | _________ | Design your own |

**Our group chose: Scale ____**

### Step A2: Calculate 1 AU on your map

The Earth–Sun distance is **1 AU = $1.5 \times 10^8$ km** (150 million km).

$$
\text{Map distance for 1 AU} = \frac{1.5 \times 10^8 \text{ km}}{\text{your scale (km per meter)}} = \underline{\phantom{0000}} \text{ meters}
$$

### Step A3: Feasibility check

Neptune is about **30 AU** from the Sun.

**Neptune on our map = 30 × (your 1 AU distance) = _______ meters**

✅ Does Neptune fit in our available space? **YES / NO**

*If NO, choose a different scale and recalculate.*

---

## Part B — Build Your Solar System Map (20 minutes)

Place tape markers on the ground at each planet's position.

### Data Table

**How to calculate:** Multiply each planet's AU distance by your "1 AU in meters" value from Part A.

| Planet | Distance from Sun (AU) | Map Distance (m) |
|--------|----------------------:|----------------:|
| Mercury | 0.39 | |
| Venus | 0.72 | |
| Earth | 1.00 | |
| Mars | 1.52 | |
| Jupiter | 5.20 | |
| Saturn | 9.58 | |
| Uranus | 19.2 | |
| Neptune | 30.1 | |

::: {.callout-warning}
## Sanity Check Before You Tape!
Before placing markers, verify:

- ✅ Mercury has the **smallest** map distance (it's closest to the Sun)
- ✅ Neptune has the **largest** map distance (it's farthest)
- ✅ Earth's distance matches your "1 AU in meters" from Part A
- ✅ Jupiter is about **5× farther** than Earth (since 5.2 AU ÷ 1 AU ≈ 5)

If any of these are wrong, check your calculations!
:::

### Show one example calculation (using scientific notation)

Pick one planet (not Earth) and show your full calculation:

**Planet:** _____________

**Step 1:** Convert AU to km using $1 \text{ AU} = 1.5 \times 10^8$ km:

Planet distance = _______ AU × $1.5 \times 10^8$ km/AU = $\_\_\_ \times 10^{\_\_}$ km

**Step 2:** Divide by your scale to get map distance:

$$
\text{Map distance} = \frac{\_\_\_ \times 10^{\_\_} \text{ km}}{\_\_\_ \times 10^{\_\_} \text{ km/m}} = \_\_\_ \times 10^{\_\_} \text{ m} = \_\_\_\_\_ \text{ m}
$$

## Part C — The Two-Scale Trap (10 minutes)

Here's the problem every astronomy diagram hides from you.

### C1: How big would the Sun be on your map?

The real Sun has a diameter of **$1.39 \times 10^6$ km**.

**Step 1:** At your scale, how many km does **1 centimeter** represent?

Your scale: 1 m = $\_\_\_ \times 10^{\_\_}$ km

So: 1 cm = (your scale) ÷ $10^2$ = $\_\_\_ \times 10^{\_\_}$ km

**Step 2:** How many centimeters is the Sun?

$$
\text{Sun diameter on map} = \frac{1.39 \times 10^6 \text{ km}}{\_\_\_ \times 10^{\_\_} \text{ km/cm}} = \_\_\_ \times 10^{\_\_} \text{ cm} = \_\_\_\_\_ \text{ cm}
$$

### C2: The reality check

At your scale:

- Could you even *see* the Sun as a dot? **YES / NO**
- What about Earth (diameter: $1.27 \times 10^4$ km)? Would it be visible? **YES / NO**

::: {.callout-tip}
## Size Reference
- 3 cm ≈ ping-pong ball
- 1 cm ≈ marble
- 0.1 cm = 1 mm ≈ grain of sand
- 0.01 cm = 0.1 mm ≈ invisible to naked eye
:::

### C3: Group discussion (2-3 sentences)

Why is it impossible to show **planet sizes** and **planet distances** accurately on the same model?

*Hint: Compare your Sun size (a few cm?) to Neptune's distance (tens of meters?).*

---

## Part D — Quick Check (If Time Permits)

Answer without a calculator — estimation is a skill!

1. If you double the scale (1 m now represents twice as many km), what happens to all map distances?

2. Jupiter is at 5.2 AU. Earth is at 1 AU. How many times farther from the Sun is Jupiter than Earth?

3. If your Earth marker is at _______ m, where should Mars (1.52 AU) be?

## Early Finishers: Go Bigger!

Done with the Solar System? Try these challenges to see just how empty space really is.

### Challenge 1: Exoplanets (Easier)

Some exoplanets orbit *much* closer to their stars than Mercury does:

- **Hot Jupiter:** 0.05 AU from its star
- **Super-Earth:** 0.02 AU from its star

Where would these go on your map? *(Hint: How many centimeters is 0.05 AU at your scale?)*

### Challenge 2: The Nearest Star (Medium)

The closest star to the Sun is **Proxima Centauri**, about **4.2 light-years** away.

**Useful fact:** 1 light-year ≈ 63,000 AU

At your scale, how far away would Proxima Centauri be? Where on Earth would you have to travel to place that marker?

### Challenge 3: The Milky Way (Hard)

The center of our galaxy is about **26,000 light-years** from the Sun.

At your scale, how far is that? Express your answer in a unit that makes sense (km? Earth circumferences? Distances to the Moon?).

## Answer Key (Scale S2: 1 m = $5 \times 10^7$ km)

**1 AU = 3 meters**

| Planet | Distance (AU) | Map Distance (m) |
|--------|-------------:|----------------:|
| Mercury | 0.39 | 1.17 |
| Venus | 0.72 | 2.16 |
| Earth | 1.00 | 3.00 |
| Mars | 1.52 | 4.56 |
| Jupiter | 5.20 | 15.6 |
| Saturn | 9.58 | 28.7 |
| Uranus | 19.2 | 57.6 |
| Neptune | 30.1 | 90.3 |

**Part C (Sun size):**
- 1 cm = $5 \times 10^5$ km (that's 500,000 km)
- Sun diameter = $\dfrac{1.39 \times 10^6 \text{ km}}{5 \times 10^5 \text{ km/cm}} = 2.78$ cm (about the size of a ping-pong ball)
- Earth = $\dfrac{1.27 \times 10^4 \text{ km}}{5 \times 10^5 \text{ km/cm}} = 0.025$ cm — **invisible**

**Part D answers:**
1. All distances are *halved*
2. Jupiter is 5.2× farther than Earth
3. Mars = 1.52 × (Earth distance)

**Early Finisher Challenges (Scale S2):**

*Challenge 1 — Exoplanets:*
- Hot Jupiter at 0.05 AU = 0.05 × 3 m = 15 cm from the star
- Super-Earth at 0.02 AU = 0.02 × 3 m = 6 cm from the star

*Challenge 2 — Proxima Centauri:*
- 4.2 light-years × 63,000 AU/ly = 264,600 AU
- At 3 m per AU: 264,600 × 3 = **793,800 meters ≈ 794 km**
- That's roughly the distance from San Diego to **San Francisco**!

*Challenge 3 — Galactic Center:*
- $2.6 \times 10^4$ ly × $6.3 \times 10^4$ AU/ly = $1.64 \times 10^9$ AU
- At 3 m per AU: $4.9 \times 10^9$ m = **$4.9 \times 10^6$ km**
- That's about **13× the Earth-Moon distance** ($3.84 \times 10^5$ km)
- Or about **3% of the Earth-Sun distance** ($1.5 \times 10^8$ km)

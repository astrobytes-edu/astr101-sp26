# Cosmic Distance Builder — Instructor Guide

## Overview

| | |
|---|---|
| **Activity** | The Cosmic Distance Builder |
| **Duration** | 45-50 minutes (35-40 core + 10 optional) |
| **Group Size** | 3-4 students |
| **Prerequisites** | None |
| **Materials Cost** | ~$5 total |

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this activity, students will be able to:

1. Read and write numbers in **scientific notation** (SLO 4: Quantitative reasoning)
2. Define a **scale** as a ratio and use **unit cancellation** to convert distances (SLO 4)
3. Explain why it's impossible to show planet sizes and distances accurately on one model (SLO 8: Critical evaluation)

### Why This Activity Works

- **Design constraint** (fit the space) forces real reasoning, not just following instructions
- **Built-in "gotcha"** (Two-Scale Trap) produces a memorable aha moment
- **Physical and collaborative** — Week 1 nerves get metabolized into tape and laughter
- **Low math barrier** — only ratios and multiplication, with worked example provided
- **Transferable skills** — the Math Background section teaches scientific notation, units, and dimensional analysis that students will use all semester

## Preparation Checklist (Day Before)

- [ ] **Measure available space** — hallway, classroom perimeter, or outdoor path. Record in meters.
- [ ] **Cut 1-meter strings** — one per group plus 2-3 extras. Use yarn, twine, or ribbon.
- [ ] **Gather materials:**
  - Masking tape (1 roll per 2 groups)
  - Markers (1 per group)
  - Worksheets (1 per group, printed)
- [ ] **Optional:** Small beads or balls (~2-3 cm) to represent the Sun
- [ ] **Write on board:** Available space = ___ meters

### Materials Alternatives

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Pre-cut 1m string** (recommended) | Cheap (~$3), tactile, portable | 5 min prep time |
| **Tape measures** | Precise | May not have enough for all groups |
| **Floor tiles** | Zero prep, zero cost | Not all rooms have tiles; size varies |
| **Pacing (steps)** | No materials needed | Less precise; calibration varies |
| **Meter sticks** | Precise | Heavy, awkward for long distances |

**Tip:** If using string, tie a small loop at each end to make it easier to hold taut.

## Facilitation Timeline

### 0-2 min: Hook

> "The distance from SDSU to downtown LA is about 190 km. If this room were a map, where would LA be? What if we wanted to fit the whole Solar System in here?"

### 2-5 min: Setup

- Form groups of 3-4
- Distribute materials (string, tape, marker, worksheet)
- Announce available space: "Your map must fit in ___ meters"
- **Briefly review the Math Background section** — hit these key points:
  - Scientific notation: $1.5 \times 10^8$ means 150 million (exponent = number of zeros)
  - Units must always be written (not optional!)
  - Unit cancellation: set up fractions so unwanted units cancel
  - The table showing "bigger scale = smaller map" (counterintuitive)
- Point to the worked example on the worksheet

### 5-15 min: Part A (Scale Selection)

Walk around and check:
- Are groups actually calculating, or just guessing?
- Did they verify Neptune fits?
- Common error: forgetting to multiply AU × (meters per AU)

**Prompt if stuck:** "Start with the worked example. What's different about your scale?"

### 15-35 min: Part B (Building the Map)

This is the fun part — let them work.

Watch for:
- Groups treating AU values as final answers (not multiplying by their scale)
- Forgetting to mark the Sun at position 0
- Running out of space (good! that's the learning)

**Prompt:** "Before you tape Jupiter down, double-check: is your calculation using your scale, or the example's scale?"

### 35-45 min: Part C (Two-Scale Trap)

This is the payoff. Guide the discussion:

1. Have groups calculate the Sun's diameter at their scale
2. Ask: "Raise your hand if the Sun would be bigger than a marble"
3. Ask: "What about Earth?"
4. Reveal: At most scales, Earth is smaller than a grain of sand

**Key discussion question:**
> "Which is more misleading: a model with correct distances but invisible planets, or correct planet sizes but all the planets piled near the Sun?"

Let them argue. There's no right answer — that's the point.

### 45-50 min: Part D (Optional)

If time permits, do the quick-check questions verbally as a class.

## Common Student Errors

| Error | What It Looks Like | How to Redirect |
|-------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Sci notation confusion** | "10^8 = 8" or "10^8 = 80" | "The exponent is how many zeros. 10^2 = 100. So 10^8 = ?" |
| **Exponent arithmetic** | 10^8 ÷ 10^7 = 10^{8/7} | "When dividing, we *subtract* exponents. 10^8 ÷ 10^7 = 10^{8-7} = ?" |
| **Dropping units** | Writing "1.5 × 10^8" instead of "1.5 × 10^8 km" | "What are the units? Without units, we can't check if the answer makes sense." |
| **Not converting** | AU values written directly in map column | "What does your scale say 1 AU equals in meters?" |
| **Wrong direction** | "Bigger scale = bigger map" | Point to the Math Background table: "Look at what happens to 1 AU as the scale number gets bigger." |
| **Units don't cancel** | Answer has "km/m" or other mixed units | "Set up the fraction so km cancels km. What's left?" |
| **Decimal confusion** | 0.39 AU = 0.39 m | "Is Mercury closer or farther than Earth? Check your answer." |
| **Forgetting the Sun** | No marker at position 0 | "Where does the Sun go?" |
| **Calculator dependence** | Paralyzed without phone | "Estimate first. Is it closer to 1 or 10?" |

## Discussion Prompts

Use these if the class discussion stalls:

- "Why do you think every textbook diagram of the Solar System is drawn 'wrong'?"
- "If you were making a museum exhibit, what would you do?"
- "The closest star to the Sun is 4 light-years away. At your scale, where would it be?" (Answer for S2: about 830 km — roughly to San Francisco!)

## Complete Answer Keys

### Scale S1: 1 m = 10⁷ km (10 million km)

1 AU = 1.5 × 10⁸ km ÷ 10⁷ km/m = **15 meters**

| Planet | AU | Map Distance (m) |
|--------|---:|----------------:|
| Mercury | 0.39 | 5.85 |
| Venus | 0.72 | 10.8 |
| Earth | 1.00 | 15.0 |
| Mars | 1.52 | 22.8 |
| Jupiter | 5.20 | 78.0 |
| Saturn | 9.58 | 143.7 |
| Uranus | 19.2 | 288 |
| Neptune | 30.1 | 451.5 |

Sun diameter: 1.39 × 10⁶ km ÷ 10⁵ km/cm = **13.9 cm** (grapefruit)
Earth diameter: 1.27 × 10⁴ km ÷ 10⁵ km/cm = **0.127 cm** (invisible)

---

### Scale S2: 1 m = 5 × 10⁷ km (50 million km) — RECOMMENDED

1 AU = 1.5 × 10⁸ km ÷ 5 × 10⁷ km/m = **3 meters**

| Planet | AU | Map Distance (m) |
|--------|---:|----------------:|
| Mercury | 0.39 | 1.17 |
| Venus | 0.72 | 2.16 |
| Earth | 1.00 | 3.00 |
| Mars | 1.52 | 4.56 |
| Jupiter | 5.20 | 15.6 |
| Saturn | 9.58 | 28.7 |
| Uranus | 19.2 | 57.6 |
| Neptune | 30.1 | 90.3 |

Sun diameter: 1.39 × 10⁶ km ÷ 5 × 10⁵ km/cm = **2.78 cm** (ping-pong ball)
Earth diameter: 1.27 × 10⁴ km ÷ 5 × 10⁵ km/cm = **0.025 cm** (invisible)

---

### Scale S3: 1 m = 10⁸ km (100 million km)

1 AU = 1.5 × 10⁸ km ÷ 10⁸ km/m = **1.5 meters**

| Planet | AU | Map Distance (m) |
|--------|---:|----------------:|
| Mercury | 0.39 | 0.59 |
| Venus | 0.72 | 1.08 |
| Earth | 1.00 | 1.50 |
| Mars | 1.52 | 2.28 |
| Jupiter | 5.20 | 7.80 |
| Saturn | 9.58 | 14.4 |
| Uranus | 19.2 | 28.8 |
| Neptune | 30.1 | 45.2 |

Sun diameter: 1.39 × 10⁶ km ÷ 10⁶ km/cm = **1.39 cm** (marble)
Earth diameter: 1.27 × 10⁴ km ÷ 10⁶ km/cm = **0.013 cm** (invisible)

---

## Part D Answers

1. **If you double the scale, map distances are halved.** (Inverse relationship)
2. **Jupiter is 5.2× farther from the Sun than Earth.** (Simple ratio)
3. **Mars = 1.52 × Earth's distance.** (If Earth is at 3 m, Mars is at 4.56 m)

## Early Finisher Challenges

These extension problems are for groups that finish early. They reinforce the lesson at progressively larger scales.

### Challenge 1: Exoplanets (5 min)

| Object | Distance (AU) | Map Distance at S2 |
|--------|-------------:|-------------------:|
| Hot Jupiter | 0.05 | 15 cm |
| Super-Earth | 0.02 | 6 cm |
| Mercury | 0.39 | 1.17 m |

**Teaching point:** Many exoplanet systems are far more compact than ours. This may be detection bias (we find close-in planets more easily) or real architectural differences.

### Challenge 2: Nearest Star (10 min)

Proxima Centauri is 4.2 light-years away.

- 1 light-year ≈ 63,000 AU
- 4.2 ly = 264,600 AU
- At Scale S2 (3 m/AU): **794 km** — roughly San Diego to San Francisco!

**Teaching point:** Even at a scale where Neptune is 90 meters away, the nearest star is in Northern California. Space is *unimaginably* empty.

### Challenge 3: Galactic Center (15 min, ambitious)

The Milky Way's center is 26,000 light-years away.

- 26,000 ly = 1.64 billion AU
- At Scale S2: **4.9 million km** — about 12× the Earth-Moon distance

**Teaching point:** At a scale where you can walk to Neptune, the galaxy is still enormous. And the Milky Way is just one of hundreds of billions of galaxies.

### When to Use These

- **Fast finishers:** Let them work independently while you help struggling groups
- **Whole-class discussion:** If everyone finishes early, do Challenge 2 together — the "San Francisco" answer always gets a reaction
- **Homework extension:** Assign Challenge 3 as optional extra credit

## Variations for Future Sessions

### Competition Mode
- Groups compete for most accurate layout
- You verify with a master tape measure
- Prize: bragging rights (or candy)

### Budget Mode
- "Each extra meter costs $10 million. You have $500 million. Optimize your scale."
- Forces tradeoff thinking

### Reverse Engineering
- Give them a completed map with unlabeled positions
- They must figure out the scale and identify planets

## Assessment Notes

### What to look for in student work:

| Component | Proficient | Developing | Beginning |
|-----------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **Scale calculation** | Correct 1 AU value with units | Minor arithmetic error | No conversion attempted |
| **Data table** | All planets calculated correctly | Most correct, 1-2 errors | AU values copied without conversion |
| **Example work** | Clear steps, correct answer | Steps shown but error | No work shown |
| **Two-Scale explanation** | Articulates the tradeoff clearly | Mentions both scales but unclear | Restates the problem without explanation |

### Misconceptions surfaced by this activity:

- "Bigger numbers = bigger map" → This activity breaks that intuition
- "Scale models are accurate" → They learn all models are compromises
- "Space is mostly planets" → They discover space is mostly... space

## Connection to Course

This activity directly supports:

- **SLO 4:** Reason quantitatively across scales — working with units, scientific notation, and proportional reasoning
- **SLO 8:** Evaluate astronomical claims critically — understanding why diagrams are misleading

Use this as a callback later:

- When discussing the **inverse-square law** (Week 3-4): "Remember how far Neptune was on your map?"
- When discussing **stellar distances** (Week 7): "At our Solar System scale, the nearest star would be in San Francisco"
- When discussing **galaxy scales** (Week 14): "If our Solar System fit in this room, the Milky Way would be..."

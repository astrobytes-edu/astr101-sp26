# Activity: **The Cosmic Distance Builder**

**Tagline:** *Build a “space map” that actually fits somewhere… without breaking math or reality.*

**Week-1, Astro 101** activity that hits the same skills as the “scale Solar System” lab (scaling, ratios, proportional reasoning), but with more *game-y* energy and a nice “wait… space is ridiculous” payoff.

### What students learn (quietly, while having fun)

* Set up and use a **scale** (a ratio)
* Convert between units (optional: keep it simple with just meters)
* Use **proportions** to compute unknown distances/sizes
* Build intuition for how **sizes and distances** relate (spoiler: not the way their brain wants)

### Time

* **35–45 minutes** in small groups (3–4 students)

### Materials (cheap + tactile)

* 1 tape measure (or meter stick) per group
* Masking tape or sticky notes + marker
* A set of **“Cosmic Cards”** (you print/cut)
* Optional “bonus”: 1 ball/bead per group for the “Sun” token

# Astro 101 — Week 1 Activity: The Cosmic Distance Builder (Scaling + Ratios)

## Big idea

In astronomy we can’t “go measure” most things directly. Instead, we use **scales** (ratios) and **proportional reasoning** to turn “wild numbers” into something we can build, test, and argue about.

Today you’ll build a *physical* scale map that fits in the space we have, and you’ll defend your scale choices like a scientist.

---

## Learning goals

By the end, you should be able to:

1. Define a scale as a **ratio** (e.g., “1 meter represents 10 million km”).
2. Use proportions to convert real distances into scaled distances.
3. Explain why one scale can make distances readable but sizes invisible (and vice versa).

---

## Part A — Choose a scale that fits (10 minutes)

You are designing a “Solar System Walkway” map that must fit in:

**Available map length:** ________ meters (your instructor will tell you)

### Step A1: Pick ONE scale option (circle)

These are written as: **1 meter on the map = (real distance)**

* **Scale S1:** 1 m = 10 million km
* **Scale S2:** 1 m = 50 million km
* **Scale S3:** 1 m = 100 million km
* **Scale S4:** You invent your own: 1 m = ______________________ km

### Step A2: Quick feasibility check

The average Earth–Sun distance is about **150 million km (1 AU)**.

At your chosen scale, what is **1 AU** on your map?

[
\text{map distance for 1 AU} = \frac{150 \text{ million km}}{\text{(million km per meter)}}
]

**1 AU on our map =** ____________ meters

Now estimate how long the map would need to reach **Neptune (~30 AU)**:

**Neptune distance ≈ 30 AU =** ____________ meters on our map

✅ Does it fit in the available space?  **YES / NO**
If NO, revise your scale.

## Part B — Build your “Space Walk” map (20 minutes)

Place tape/sticky notes on the ground/wall at the positions of each object.

### Data table (distances from the Sun)

Use **AU** first, then convert to meters using your “1 AU = ___ meters” result.

| Object  | Distance (AU) | Map distance (m) |
| ------- | ------------: | ---------------: |
| Mercury |          0.39 |                  |
| Venus   |          0.72 |                  |
| Earth   |          1.00 |                  |
| Mars    |          1.52 |                  |
| Jupiter |          5.20 |                  |
| Saturn  |          9.58 |                  |
| Uranus  |          19.2 |                  |
| Neptune |          30.1 |                  |

**Show at least one example calculation clearly (pick one planet):**
Example planet: ______________

## Part C — The “Two-Scale Trap” (10 minutes)

Now we confront a classic astronomy problem: **one scale rarely works for everything.**

### C1: If the Sun were a 2 cm dot…

The real Sun diameter is about **1.39 million km**.

If your map uses: 1 m = __________ million km, then:

1 m = __________ million km
So 1 cm = __________ million km / 100
Sun (1.39 million km) would be:

**Sun diameter on map =** __________ cm

✅ Does that match the 2 cm dot assumption? **YES / NO**

### C2: Your group’s conclusion (write 2–3 sentences)

Why is it hard to show **planet sizes** and **planet distances** accurately on one model?

---

## Part D — Mini-check (5 minutes)

Answer without a calculator if you can (estimation is a skill).

1. If you double the scale (make “1 m represents twice as many km”), what happens to all map distances?

---

2. If Earth is at 1 AU and Jupiter is at 5.2 AU, then Jupiter is about how many times farther from the Sun than Earth?

---

3. If your Earth marker is at ______ m, where should Mars be (in meters)?

---

---

## Extension (optional, if time)

**The Exoplanet Add-On:** Add a “hot Jupiter” at 0.05 AU and a “super-Earth” at 0.02 AU.
Where do they go on your map, and why do exoplanet systems often look nothing like ours?

---

## Turn in

One sheet per group with:

* Your chosen scale
* Completed table
* One example calculation
* Your Part C explanation

### Instructor notes (so it runs smoothly)

* **Set the “available map length”** to something real: a hallway segment, the classroom perimeter, or “we have 12 meters.” The constraint forces scale choice (that’s where the reasoning lives).
* Walk around and listen for these common bugs:

  * Treating AU as “a distance” but not converting using their chosen scale
  * Mixing up “bigger scale” vs “bigger numbers”
  * Forgetting everything is linear (doubling scale halves map distances, etc.)
* **Best discussion prompt (2 minutes):**
  “Which is more misleading: a model with correct distances but invisible planets, or correct planet sizes but planets all piled near the Sun?”

### Why this is “more interesting” than the classic version

* It has a *design constraint* (fit the space) → feels like a real problem, not a worksheet
* It includes a built-in “gotcha” (**two-scale trap**) that produces a good class discussion
* It’s physical and collaborative, so week-1 nerves get socially metabolized into tape and laughter

If you want to crank the fun dial higher later, you can turn the “Cosmic Cards” into a quick **competition** (“closest to correct layout wins”) or add a “budget” mechanic (“each extra meter costs $10 million—optimize your scale”).

# Activity: Why the Moon Looks the Same Size as the Sun (and Why Eclipses Are Rare)

**Course:** ASTR 101 — Principles of Astronomy
**Instructor** Anna Rosen
**Week:** (TBD)
**Estimated time:** 50 minutes
**Format:** Small groups (2–4) + whole-class check-ins
**What you need:** Pencil, ruler (optional), and either (a) a lamp + ball/sphere *or* (b) a moon-phase simulation

---

## Big Idea (read this first)

Astronomy is the art of learning huge truths from tiny angles.

Today you’ll connect three ideas into one coherent story:

1. **Angular size:** why things *look* big or small depends on **size and distance**.
2. **Moon phases:** the Moon’s changing appearance is a **geometry problem**, not a “shadow” problem.
3. **Eclipses:** eclipses are **rare** because the Moon’s orbit is **tilted**, so perfect alignments don’t happen every month.

---

## Learning goals

By the end of this activity, you should be able to:

* Explain angular size in words and with a simple sketch.
* Predict the Moon’s phase from the Sun–Earth–Moon geometry.
* Explain why eclipses don’t happen every month, and identify the conditions needed for solar vs. lunar eclipses.

---

## Key vocabulary (use in your answers)

* **Angular size**: how large an object appears in the sky (an angle, not a physical size).
* **Illuminated half**: the half of a sphere lit by the Sun (always half).
* **Phase**: the portion of the illuminated half that we can see from Earth.
* **Eclipse**: when the Sun, Earth, and Moon line up closely enough for one to cast a shadow on another.
* **Orbital tilt**: the Moon’s orbital plane is tilted by about **5°** relative to Earth’s orbit around the Sun.
* **Node**: the place(s) where the Moon’s orbit crosses Earth’s orbital plane.

---

## Part A — Angular size: “Looks the same size” (10–15 min)

### A1. Warm-up: the thumb trick

Hold your thumb at arm’s length and “cover” something across the room (like a door handle or a clock). Now move your thumb closer to your eye. What changes?

**Write 2–3 sentences:**

* What changed about how big your thumb *looked*?
* Did your thumb physically change size?

> **Checkpoint:** Your answer should include the idea: *“Same object, different distance → different apparent size.”*

---

### A2. The rule (no trig required)

For our purposes today:

> **Angular size ∝ (object size) / (distance to the object)**

In plain English:

* Bigger objects look bigger.
* Farther objects look smaller.
* If something is **k times bigger** but also **k times farther**, it can look the **same** size.

**Question:**
Suppose Object A is **400× bigger** than Object B, but also **400× farther away**.

* Which one looks bigger? Or do they look the same size?
* Explain using the proportionality above.

**Your answer (2–4 sentences):**

---

### A3. Apply to the sky (conceptual)

The Sun is vastly bigger than the Moon, yet in our sky they appear similar in size.

**Claim:** The Sun and Moon have similar angular sizes in Earth’s sky.
**What that *implies*:** the Sun is also vastly farther away (relative to its size).

**Task:** In 2–3 sentences, explain how *both* of these can be true:

* The Sun is much larger than the Moon.
* The Sun and Moon look about the same size in our sky.

---

**[FIGURE PLACEHOLDER A]**
*Add an illustration showing angular size as an angle at the observer, with two objects of different sizes at different distances producing the same apparent angle.*
**Detailed description to add later:** (TBD)

---

## Part B — Moon phases: the geometry of light (15–20 min)

### B1. The single most important fact

The Sun always illuminates **half** of the Moon.

So the phase is not “how much is lit,” but **how much of the lit half we can see** from Earth.

**Write 1 sentence in your own words defining “phase”:**

---

### B2. Build the model (choose one)

**Option 1: Physical model**

* Lamp = Sun (stationary)
* Your head = Earth
* Ball = Moon (hold it at arm’s length)

**Option 2: Simulation**
Use a moon-phase simulation (instructor-provided link or app).

**Instruction:** Move the “Moon” around “Earth” and observe how the visible lit portion changes.

---

### B3. Four anchor phases (sketch + label)

Complete the table below. For each phase:

* Draw a simple diagram showing the Sun, Earth, and Moon positions.
* Draw what the Moon looks like from Earth.

| Phase         | Geometry sketch (Sun–Earth–Moon) | What we see from Earth |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| New Moon      | (your sketch)                    | (dark / nearly dark)   |
| First Quarter | (your sketch)                    | (half lit)             |
| Full Moon     | (your sketch)                    | (fully lit)            |
| Third Quarter | (your sketch)                    | (half lit)             |

**Important:** Your sketch should show the **Sun’s direction** clearly.

---

**[FIGURE PLACEHOLDER B]**
*Add a clean 4-panel diagram showing Sun–Earth–Moon geometry for new/first quarter/full/third quarter with the corresponding view of the Moon as seen from Earth.*
**Detailed description to add later:** (TBD)

---

### B4. Misconception check (write this carefully)

Many people say: “The Moon’s phases are caused by Earth’s shadow.”

**Is that correct?** Yes / No
**Explain in 2–4 sentences:**

* What actually causes phases?
* When *does* Earth’s shadow matter?

---

## Part C — Eclipses: why they don’t happen every month (15–20 min)

### C1. The puzzle

If new moon and full moon happen every month, why don’t we get:

* a solar eclipse every new moon?
* a lunar eclipse every full moon?

**Write your best hypothesis (1–2 sentences):**

---

### C2. The missing ingredient: orbital tilt

The Moon’s orbit is tilted by about **5°** compared to Earth’s orbit around the Sun.

That means most months, the Moon passes:

* slightly above the Sun–Earth line at new moon, or
* slightly above/below Earth’s shadow at full moon.

**Task:** In your own words, explain how a small tilt can prevent most eclipses (2–4 sentences).

---

**[FIGURE PLACEHOLDER C]**
*Add an illustration showing two orbital planes: Earth’s orbital plane (“ecliptic”) and the Moon’s tilted orbital plane, including the line of nodes and a depiction of near-miss alignments at most new/full moons.*
**Detailed description to add later:** (TBD)

---

### C3. Nodes: the “eclipse gate”

An eclipse requires:

1. the **right phase**, and
2. being near a **node** (where the Moon crosses the ecliptic plane).

Complete the checklist:

**Solar eclipse happens when:**

* [ ] The Moon is at **new moon**
* [ ] The Moon is near a **node**
* [ ] The Moon is between the **Sun and Earth**

**Lunar eclipse happens when:**

* [ ] The Moon is at **full moon**
* [ ] The Moon is near a **node**
* [ ] The Earth is between the **Sun and Moon**

---

### C4. Quick classification (circle one)

For each scenario, decide what is *possible*.

1. **New moon, far from a node** → Solar eclipse possible? **Yes / No**
2. **New moon, near a node** → Solar eclipse possible? **Yes / No**
3. **Full moon, far from a node** → Lunar eclipse possible? **Yes / No**
4. **Full moon, near a node** → Lunar eclipse possible? **Yes / No**

Write 1 sentence explaining the pattern you see:

---

## Wrap-up: the single story (5 min)

### Final prompt (short paragraph)

In a single paragraph (4–7 sentences), explain **all three** of these in one coherent explanation:

* Why the Sun and Moon can look similar in size in our sky
* What causes moon phases
* Why eclipses are rare

Aim for clarity over fancy words.

---

## Optional extension (if time)

**Extension idea:** “Eclipse seasons”
Explain why eclipses tend to occur in clusters (separated by about 6 months), using the idea of nodes and orbital motion.

---

## Submission checklist

Make sure your work includes:

* ✅ A clear explanation of angular size (Part A)
* ✅ The four-phase geometry sketches (Part B)
* ✅ The eclipse conditions checklists + classifications (Part C)
* ✅ Your final coherent paragraph (Wrap-up)

# Activity: Seasons, Orbits, and Planetary Temperatures

**Author:** Anna Rosen

(*Perihelion/Aphelion, Eccentricity, Axial Tilt, and Why “Distance = Seasons” Is a Trap*)

## Purpose (what you’re trying to figure out)

You’ll build a causal model of planetary temperature and seasons by separating three ideas that students often mash together:

1. **How much energy arrives** (insolation),
2. **How that energy is spread out** (tilt + day length + Sun angle),
3. **How much sticks around** (albedo + greenhouse + thermal inertia).

By the end, you should be able to explain **what seasons actually are**, what **eccentricity** actually changes, and why **perihelion/aphelion** rarely dominate seasonal temperature on Earth.

## Learning goals

By the end of this activity, you will be able to:

* Distinguish **axial tilt seasons** from **distance-from-star effects**.
* Define **perihelion/aphelion** (or periastron/apastron) and **eccentricity**, and predict what they change.
* Use proportional reasoning to estimate how temperature responds to changes in incoming stellar energy.
* Explain why **two planets at the same distance** can have very different temperatures (atmosphere + albedo).

## Materials

* Blank paper or whiteboard space
* A globe (or ball) + lamp/flashlight (optional but great)
* Calculator (optional)

## Part A — Warm-up: Your gut instincts (5 minutes)

**A1.** Circle the statement(s) you think are true *right now*:

* (a) Seasons are caused mainly by Earth being closer/farther from the Sun.
* (b) Seasons are caused mainly by Earth’s axial tilt.
* (c) Earth is closest to the Sun during Northern Hemisphere summer.
* (d) Earth is closest to the Sun during Northern Hemisphere winter.

**A2.** In one sentence: What changes from summer to winter where you live?

> Keep your answers. You’ll revisit them later and see what your brain corrected.

## Part B — The “Sun angle” machine (10–12 minutes)

**B1.** Sketch Earth and draw Earth’s rotation axis. Now draw two cases:

* Case 1: **Northern Hemisphere tilted toward the Sun**
* Case 2: **Northern Hemisphere tilted away from the Sun**

For each case, answer:

* Which hemisphere gets **more direct sunlight** (higher Sun angle)?
* Which hemisphere gets **longer days**?
* Which hemisphere gets more **total daily energy**?

**B2.** Concept check (talk it out, no equations required):
Why does “more direct sunlight” warm a surface more than “slanted sunlight,” even if the light source is equally bright?

*Hint: same energy spread over a bigger area → energy per square meter goes down.*

## Part C — Orbit distance: perihelion/aphelion effects (12–15 minutes)

We’ll isolate the **distance effect** without tilt.

### Definitions (write in your own words)

* **Perihelion/periastron:** __________________________
* **Aphelion/apastron:** __________________________
* **Eccentricity (e):** __________________________

### Key proportional rule (given)

Incoming energy from a star scales like: **Energy ∝ 1 / distance²**

**C1.** Suppose Planet X has an eccentric orbit. At perihelion it is at distance **rₚ**, and at aphelion it is at **rₐ = 1.2 rₚ**.

1. How does incoming energy at aphelion compare to perihelion?
   Compute the ratio:
   [
   E_a / E_p = (r_p / r_a)^2 = (1/1.2)^2 \approx 0.69
   ]
   So aphelion gets about **69%** as much incoming energy as perihelion.

2. Temperature doesn’t track energy 1:1. A useful approximation is:
   [
   T \propto E^{1/4}
   ]
   So temperature ratio is:
   [
   T_a / T_p \approx 0.69^{1/4} \approx 0.91
   ]
   That’s about a **9% temperature drop** (if nothing else changes).

**C2.** Discussion: Does that feel “huge” or “meh”?
What real-world factors could make the observed temperature swing smaller than this simple estimate?

*Ideas: oceans/thermal inertia, atmosphere circulation, clouds/albedo changes, greenhouse buffering.*

## Part D — The showdown: tilt vs eccentricity (15 minutes)

Now we compare two planets.

### Planet A (Earth-like tilt)

* Tilt: **23.5°**
* Nearly circular orbit (low eccentricity)

### Planet B (high eccentricity, low tilt)

* Tilt: **0°**
* Eccentric orbit with **rₐ = 1.2 rₚ** (same as Part C)

**D1. Predict:** Which planet has stronger “seasons” (meaning bigger temperature differences at mid-latitudes)? Why?

**D2. Argue it with mechanisms:**
For each planet, list the main driver(s) of seasonal temperature change:

* Planet A: __________________________
* Planet B: __________________________

**D3. Reality check:**
Could Planet B have seasons at all if tilt = 0°?
If yes, what would “seasons” look like (global vs regional)?

---

## Part E — Bonus twist: perihelion timing matters (8–10 minutes)

Even if distance effects are small, the **timing** can matter.

**E1.** Imagine a planet with Earth-like tilt *and* noticeable eccentricity.
Case 1: Northern Hemisphere summer happens at **perihelion**
Case 2: Northern Hemisphere summer happens at **aphelion**

For each case, predict how Northern Hemisphere summers compare (hotter/colder) and explain why.

**E2.** Which hemisphere would likely have “more extreme” seasons in Case 1?
(Assume everything else equal.)

---

## Part F — Planetary temperatures aren’t just distance (10 minutes)

Two planets orbit at the **same distance** from the same star.

* Planet C: dark ocean world, thick CO₂ atmosphere
* Planet D: bright icy world, thin atmosphere

**F1.** Which is warmer? Give two reasons.
**F2.** Label which category each reason belongs to:

* Incoming energy (distance/star)
* Reflection (albedo/clouds)
* Heat trapping (greenhouse)
* Heat storage/transport (thermal inertia/circulation)

---

## Synthesis: The one-minute model (wrap-up)

Write a 3–4 sentence explanation that would convince a smart friend that:

1. **Earth’s seasons are mainly tilt-driven**, and
2. **distance/orbit shape still matters sometimes**, but usually not the main character.

---

## Instructor notes (quick)

### Common misconceptions to surface

* “Closer = summer.”
* “Eccentricity doesn’t matter at all.” (It can — especially for high-e worlds, or when perihelion aligns with a hemisphere’s summer.)
* “Temperature follows energy linearly.” (The (1/4) power dependence is a great conceptual lever.)

### Quick extensions (pick one)

* **Graphical:** students sketch Sun angle vs latitude for solstice vs equinox.
* **Data:** compare Mars’ eccentricity and seasonal asymmetry (southern summer vs northern summer).
* **Exoplanets:** discuss tidally locked planets around M dwarfs: “season” vs “day–night climate.”

### Minimal “math mode” option

You can run the whole activity with just:

* Energy ∝ 1/r²
* Temperature ∝ E^(1/4)
  …and keep it strictly proportional reasoning.

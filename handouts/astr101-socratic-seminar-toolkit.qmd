## Scholarly Engagement & Seminar Norms

### What is “Scholarly Engagement” (10%)?
In this course, your engagement grade measures something *real*: whether you are practicing the skills scientists use to build understanding together.

You earn Scholarly Engagement credit through:
- **iClicker participation** during in-class questions (often think–pair–share).
- **In-class group inquiry activities.**
- **Socratic Seminars** (a structured discussion where we interpret a shared “text,” often a figure, spectrum, short excerpt, or dataset).

This is not “points for talking.” It’s credit for *doing the intellectual work* of astronomy in community.

### What “good engagement” looks like (examples)
During discussion, lab-style activities, or seminar, strong engagement sounds like:

- “My claim is ___, **because** the plot shows ___.”
- “I’m not fully sure, but I think ___ **under the assumption that** ___.”
- “Can we check the axis / units / trend again? If that’s true, then ___.”
- “An alternative explanation could be ___. What observation would separate them?”

You do *not* need to be loud to be engaged. You do need to be *evidence-based* and *constructive*.

### Socratic Seminar norms (how we talk like scientists)
In seminar, our goal is **shared inquiry**, not performance.

**1) Anchor claims in evidence.**  
If you make a claim, point to something specific: a line in the text, a feature in the figure, an axis label, a trend, a number.

**2) Name assumptions out loud.**  
Astronomy is inference under constraints. Assumptions are part of the job, not something to hide.

**3) Disagree with ideas, not people.**  
Use: “I interpret it differently because…” not “That’s wrong.”

**4) Share the airtime.**  
If you’ve spoken a lot, practice listening. If you’ve been quiet, try one contribution:
a question, a clarification, or one evidence-based claim.

**5) Let uncertainty be normal (but not vague).**  
Uncertainty is fine. Vague claims are not. Try: “I’m ~70% confident because…”

### Practical seminar roles (so everyone can contribute)
Depending on the day, you may be in an **inner circle** (speaking) or **outer circle** (observing + supporting).

Outer circle contributions that count as full engagement:
- Track where the group used **evidence** well (and where we didn’t).
- Notice **assumptions** that were stated (or missing).
- Identify a moment when someone **revised** their thinking.
- Offer one “what would we measure next?” question during the debrief.

### What hurts your Scholarly Engagement grade
- Side conversations during class or seminar
- Phone use that distracts you or others
- Dismissing classmates instead of engaging their reasoning
- Speaking without evidence (repeatedly) after redirection

### Academic integrity and AI tools
Your thinking matters here. **Generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, Claude) are prohibited for course-related assessments.**  
That includes any for-credit written seminar prep/reflections, if assigned. If you’re unsure whether something counts, ask before submitting.

## Discourse Kit

### Evidence & Reasoning Sentence Starters
Use these in Socratic Seminar, think–pair–share, and group inquiry activities. The goal is not fancy wording—it’s clear scientific thinking.

#### Claim (what you think is true)
- “A conservative interpretation is that…”
- “The figure suggests that…”
- “My current best claim is…”

#### Evidence (what you’re pointing to)
- “I’m basing that on ___ (axis/line/value/quote)…”
- “In the region where ___, the trend shows…”
- “The key detail is ___, which indicates…”

#### Reasoning (why the evidence supports the claim)
- “That supports the claim because…”
- “If ___ increases, then ___ should change because…”
- “The physical story is: ___ → ___ → ___.”

#### Assumptions (what must be true)
- “This depends on the assumption that…”
- “We’re implicitly assuming ___ (calibration / geometry / equilibrium / negligible dust)…”
- “If that assumption fails, the conclusion could change by…”

#### Alternative explanations (how to avoid tunnel vision)
- “Another explanation consistent with the data is…”
- “A competing model would predict…”
- “These interpretations differ mainly in the assumption that…”

#### Uncertainty (allowed; vagueness is not)
- “I’m about __% confident because…”
- “The biggest uncertainty is…”
- “I’m unsure whether ___ or ___, because the data don’t constrain…”

#### Discriminating tests (what would we measure next?)
- “A measurement that would distinguish these is…”
- “If we observe ___, it would support model A; if we observe ___, it would support model B.”
- “The next-best observation would be ___ because it reduces the degeneracy between…”

#### Building on others (collaboration moves)
- “I want to build on what ___ said by adding…”
- “I agree with ___ under the condition that…”
- “I interpret that differently because the evidence suggests…”

### Common Astronomy Inference Pitfalls
Astronomy is inference under constraints. These pitfalls are *normal*—the goal is to notice them early and build guardrails.

Use this sheet during problem-solving and seminar.

#### 1) Mixing up what’s measured vs what’s inferred
**Guardrail:** Write “Observable:” and “Inference:” separately.  
Example: flux is measured; distance is inferred using a model.

#### 2) Confusing brightness with luminosity
- **Brightness (flux)** depends on distance.
- **Luminosity** is intrinsic power output.  
**Guardrail:** Ask: “Is this property distance-dependent?”

#### 3) Treating a model assumption as a fact
Examples: circular orbits, equilibrium, “standard candle,” negligible dust.  
**Guardrail:** Say: “This conclusion holds *if* ____.”

#### 4) Over-claiming (data show X → therefore theory Y is true)
Data usually constrain a *family* of models.  
**Guardrail:** Ask: “What else could explain this pattern?”

#### 5) Ignoring selection effects (“what got into the dataset?”)
What you observe is shaped by detection limits and survey design.  
**Guardrail:** Ask: “What might be missing, and why?”

#### 6) Forgetting units or axis scaling (especially log axes)
A straight line on a log plot means something different than on a linear plot.  
**Guardrail:** Always write the units and identify linear vs log.

#### 7) Confusing correlation with causation
Two quantities can vary together due to a third variable or measurement bias.  
**Guardrail:** Ask: “What mechanism connects them? What would break the trend?”

#### 8) Treating uncertainty as a footnote
Uncertainty is part of the claim.  
**Guardrail:** Try: “I’m ~__% confident because…” and name your biggest uncertainty.

#### 9) Single-figure tunnel vision
A great plot can still be misleading without context (calibration, sample, method).  
**Guardrail:** Ask: “What information is missing that could change interpretation?”

**The most scientific question you can ask:**  
**“What observation would discriminate between these explanations?”**

## Figure Kit

### How to Read a Scientific Figure (Micro-Guide)

**Name:** ____________________________  **Date:** ____________________

Astronomy is a science of *inference*. A figure is not “the truth”—it’s a compact argument made out of data, axes, and assumptions.

#### Step 0: Identify the figure’s job (one sentence)
**This figure is trying to show:**  
______________________________________________________________________________

#### Step 1: Read the axes like a scientist
- **What are the axes?** (write the full variable names, not just symbols)  
  **x-axis:** ________________________________   **units:** ________________  
  **y-axis:** ________________________________   **units:** ________________

- **What is *measured* vs *inferred*?**  
  **Measured (observables):** __________________________________________________  
  **Inferred (model-dependent):** ______________________________________________

- **What is the scale?** (linear/log; important!)  
  ☐ linear  ☐ log  ☐ mixed/other: ______________________

#### Step 2: Describe the pattern (before you interpret it)
Use literal description first.

- **Trend:** ___________________________________________________________________  
- **Scatter / uncertainty:** ___________________________________________________  
- **Outliers:** ________________________________________________________________  
- **Range / limits:** __________________________________________________________

If error bars exist: what do they represent? ☐ measurement error ☐ intrinsic scatter ☐ not sure

#### Step 3: What claim does the figure support (conservatively)?
**Conservative claim (supported by what’s shown):**  
______________________________________________________________________________  
**Evidence in the figure (point to a specific feature/value/region):**  
______________________________________________________________________________

#### Step 4: Name at least one assumption
Interpretation requires assumptions. Name one.

**Assumption:** _______________________________________________________________  
**If this assumption fails, the interpretation might change because:**  
______________________________________________________________________________

#### Step 5: Ask the “discriminating test” question
What new measurement would best reduce ambiguity?

**Next measurement:** _________________________________________________________  
**If we saw ________, it would strengthen the claim. If we saw ________, it would weaken it.**

#### Quick checklist (for seminar)
☐ I can say what each axis means and its units.  
☐ I separated *description* from *interpretation*.  
☐ I named at least one assumption.  
☐ I can propose a next measurement.

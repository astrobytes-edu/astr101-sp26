## 1) My Claim (one sentence)

Write a *specific* claim that you think the “text” supports.

**Claim:**  
______________________________________________________________________________  
______________________________________________________________________________

## 2) Evidence (two concrete pieces)

Point to *specific* evidence: a quoted phrase, a trend, an axis label + value, a feature in a spectrum, etc.

______________________________________________________________________________  
**Why it supports my claim (one sentence):**

## 3) Assumption (what must be true for my claim to hold)

Name at least one assumption your inference relies on. (Examples: equilibrium, calibration, geometry, negligible dust, “standard candle” validity, selection effects.)

**Assumption:**  
______________________________________________________________________________  
**If this assumption fails, my claim would change like this:**  
______________________________________________________________________________

Try a confidence estimate *with a reason*.

**I am about** _______% **confident because**

If you had one new observation/measurement you could make, what would best test your claim or distinguish between competing explanations?

**Next measurement:**  
______________________________________________________________________________  
**What outcome would strengthen my claim?**  
______________________________________________________________________________  
**What outcome would weaken my claim?**  
______________________________________________________________________________

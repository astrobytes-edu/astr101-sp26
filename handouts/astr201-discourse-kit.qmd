## Evidence & Reasoning Sentence Starters
Use these in Socratic Seminar, think–pair–share, and group inquiry activities. The goal is not fancy wording—it’s clear scientific thinking.

### Claim (what you think is true)
- “A conservative interpretation is that…”
- “The figure suggests that…”
- “My current best claim is…”

### Evidence (what you’re pointing to)
- “I’m basing that on ___ (axis/line/value/quote)…”
- “In the region where ___, the trend shows…”
- “The key detail is ___, which indicates…”

### Reasoning (why the evidence supports the claim)
- “That supports the claim because…”
- “If ___ increases, then ___ should change because…”
- “The physical story is: ___ → ___ → ___.”

### Assumptions (what must be true)
- “This depends on the assumption that…”
- “We’re implicitly assuming ___ (calibration / geometry / equilibrium / negligible dust)…”
- “If that assumption fails, the conclusion could change by…”

### Alternative explanations (how to avoid tunnel vision)
- “Another explanation consistent with the data is…”
- “A competing model would predict…”
- “These interpretations differ mainly in the assumption that…”

### Uncertainty (allowed; vagueness is not)
- “I’m about __% confident because…”
- “The biggest uncertainty is…”
- “I’m unsure whether ___ or ___, because the data don’t constrain…”

### Discriminating tests (what would we measure next?)
- “A measurement that would distinguish these is…”
- “If we observe ___, it would support model A; if we observe ___, it would support model B.”
- “The next-best observation would be ___ because it reduces the degeneracy between…”

### Building on others (collaboration moves)
- “I want to build on what ___ said by adding…”
- “I agree with ___ under the condition that…”
- “I interpret that differently because the evidence suggests…”

## Common Astronomy Inference Pitfalls
Astronomy is inference under constraints. These pitfalls are *normal*—the goal is to notice them early and build guardrails.

Use this sheet during problem-solving and seminar.

### 1) Mixing up what’s measured vs what’s inferred
**Guardrail:** Write “Observable:” and “Inference:” separately.  
Example: flux is measured; distance is inferred using a model.

### 2) Confusing brightness with luminosity
- **Brightness (flux)** depends on distance.
- **Luminosity** is intrinsic power output.  
**Guardrail:** Ask: “Is this property distance-dependent?”

### 3) Treating a model assumption as a fact
Examples: circular orbits, equilibrium, “standard candle,” negligible dust.  
**Guardrail:** Say: “This conclusion holds *if* ____.”

### 4) Over-claiming (data show X → therefore theory Y is true)
Data usually constrain a *family* of models.  
**Guardrail:** Ask: “What else could explain this pattern?”

### 5) Ignoring selection effects (“what got into the dataset?”)
What you observe is shaped by detection limits and survey design.  
**Guardrail:** Ask: “What might be missing, and why?”

### 6) Forgetting units or axis scaling (especially log axes)
A straight line on a log plot means something different than on a linear plot.  
**Guardrail:** Always write the units and identify linear vs log.

### 7) Confusing correlation with causation
Two quantities can vary together due to a third variable or measurement bias.  
**Guardrail:** Ask: “What mechanism connects them? What would break the trend?”

### 8) Treating uncertainty as a footnote
Uncertainty is part of the claim.  
**Guardrail:** Try: “I’m ~__% confident because…” and name your biggest uncertainty.

### 9) Single-figure tunnel vision
A great plot can still be misleading without context (calibration, sample, method).  
**Guardrail:** Ask: “What information is missing that could change interpretation?”

### The most scientific question you can ask
**“What observation would discriminate between these explanations?”**

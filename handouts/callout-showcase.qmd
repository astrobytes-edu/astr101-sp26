## Active Learning Callouts

::: {.callout-check-yourself}
**Sample prompt:** A star appears to wobble periodically. Which observable is this?
:::

::: {.callout-prediction}
Before reading further, predict: what color will a 10,000 K star appear?
:::

::: {.callout-tps}
**Think:** What determines a star's color?
**Pair:** Compare your answer with a neighbor.
**Share:** One insight from your discussion.
:::

## Content Callouts

::: {.callout-key-insight}
**Physics tells you what relationships are allowed.** The inverse-square law isn't arbitrary—it's geometry.
:::

::: {.callout-worked-example}
**Problem:** Calculate the frequency of red light (λ = 700 nm).

**Solution:**
$\nu = c/\lambda = (3 \times 10^{10}\ \text{cm/s}) / (7 \times 10^{-5}\ \text{cm}) = 4.3 \times 10^{14}\ \text{Hz}$
:::

::: {.callout-deep-dive collapse="true"}
The inverse-square law follows from geometry: a sphere's surface area is $4\pi r^2$. As light spreads over larger spheres, the energy per unit area drops as $1/r^2$.
:::

::: {.callout-the-more-you-know collapse="true"}
Henrietta Leavitt discovered the period-luminosity relation for Cepheids in 1912 while cataloging variable stars in the Magellanic Clouds. She was paid 30 cents per hour.

## Structural Callouts

| 1.2 | The Spoiler Reel | 20 min |

::: {.callout-summary}
**Key points from this section:**

- We measure four things directly: flux, position, wavelength, timing
- Everything else is inferred through models
- The gap between measurement and knowledge is where physics lives
:::

::: {.callout-why-this-matters}
Distance measurements aren't just bookkeeping—they give us the age of the universe. Without Cepheids and supernovae, we wouldn't know we live in a 13.8-billion-year-old cosmos.
:::

## Metacognitive Callouts

::: {.callout-misconception}
**"Astronomers measure the temperature of stars directly."**

Wrong. We measure the spectrum (wavelength distribution). Temperature is *inferred* from Wien's Law.
:::

::: {.callout-problem}
A star at 10 pc has apparent magnitude m = 5. What is its absolute magnitude M?
:::

::: {.callout-solution}
M = m - 5 log(d/10) = 5 - 5 log(1) = 5
:::

::: {.callout-sanity-check}
**Units check:** Does $L = 4\pi r^2 \sigma T^4$ give watts?

$[\text{m}^2][\text{W/m}^2\text{K}^4][\text{K}^4] = [\text{W}]$ ✓
:::

::: {.callout-frontier}
**Hubble Tension:** Different methods give different values for $H_0$. Is this measurement error or new physics?

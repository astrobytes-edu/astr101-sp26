## Header (fill in)

* **Name:**
* **RedID:**
* **Section / Meeting time:**
* **Growth Statement:** GS1 (after Midterm 1) / GS2 (after Midterm 2) / GS3 (pre-final)
* **Date submitted:**
* **Time spent writing this:** ~30–45 minutes (target)

**Length target:** ~400–600 words total (concise + specific). Bullet points are welcome if they contain real substance.

---

## 0) Quick checklist (required)

Check each box before you submit:

* [ ] I referenced specific evidence (exam question numbers + what happened).
* [ ] I identified my **top 2–3 recurring patterns** (not just “I need to study more”).
* [ ] I wrote **2–3 concrete habits** I will implement, with “when → I will” plans.
* [ ] I included a **verification plan** (how I’ll know it’s working).
* [ ] I completed the **AI reflection** section (even if “no AI used”).

## 1) Evidence Snapshot (required)

Fill in **at least 3 rows**. Use Midterm/Homework/Practice as evidence.

| Evidence item (e.g., “Midterm 1 Q4”) | What happened (1 sentence) | Error type(s)                                                          | What would have caught it?                                              |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|                                      |                            | units / algebra / concept / sign / assumptions / interpretation / time | units check / limiting case / diagram / reread prompt / sanity estimate |
|                                      |                            |                                                                        |                                                                         |
|                                      |                            |                                                                        |                                                                         |
|                                      |                            |                                                                        |                                                                         |

## 2) Pattern diagnosis (required)

Answer these questions **in complete sentences** (short is fine).

**2.1 Top patterns (choose 2–3):**
List your most common patterns as *specific behaviors*, not labels.

* Pattern A:
* Pattern B:
* (Optional) Pattern C:

**2.2 What triggers them?**
When do these patterns show up most (time pressure, multi-step problems, conceptual questions, translating words → equations, etc.)?

**2.3 What do they cost you?**
Be specific: points, time, confidence, wrong physical conclusion, etc.

---

## 3) Root cause (required)

For **one** major pattern, do a short “why-chain.”

**Pattern chosen:** ________

* Why did this happen?
* Why *again*? (what habit/system causes it to repeat?)
* What is the earliest moment you could intervene?

*(This is not therapy; it’s debugging.)*

---

## 4) What actually worked (required)

List **2 strategies** that *did* help you learn this unit. Each must be tied to evidence.

* Strategy 1: What I did + evidence it worked (e.g., “I did timed practice twice; pacing improved on Q2/Q5”).
* Strategy 2: What I did + evidence it worked.

---

## 5) Intervention plan (required: 2–3 habits)

Write **2–3** habits in this exact “implementation intention” format:

### Habit 1

* **When I…** (specific moment)
* **I will…** (specific action)
* **Because…** (1 sentence: what error it prevents)
* **Verification:** how I’ll check this worked (units? checklist? score pattern? time log?)

### Habit 2

* **When I…**
* **I will…**
* **Because…**
* **Verification:**

### (Optional) Habit 3

* **When I…**
* **I will…**
* **Because…**
* **Verification:**

---

## 6) Study plan (required for GS3; optional for GS1/GS2)

### GS1/GS2 (optional)

One week plan (2–4 bullets). What will you do differently *starting this week*?

### GS3 (required: pre-final plan)

Write a concrete plan for the **7 days before the final**:

* **What topics will you practice each day?**
* **What will you do for retrieval practice?** (self-testing, blank-page recall, timed problems)
* **What will you do to simulate exam conditions?** (timed set, no notes, then review)
* **What will you do for error review?** (rework missed problems; checklist)

*(A plan you can actually execute beats a plan you admire.)*

---

## 7) Learning reflection (required, brief)

Answer **all**:

1. What did you learn about **how you learn** in this unit?
2. What surprised you about your performance (good or bad)?
3. What’s one thing you’re proud of improving (even if you’re not “there” yet)?

---

## 8) AI reflection (required)

Even if you didn’t use AI, complete this section.

**8.1 Did you use AI tools for studying this unit?** Yes / No

If **No**:

* Why not? (1–2 sentences)

If **Yes** (check all that apply):

* [ ] Course NotebookLM Notebook (course-grounded)
* [ ] ASTR 101 Socratic Tutor (Custom GPT)
* [ ] Other: ________

**8.2 What did you use AI for?** (check all that apply)

* [ ] Clarifying concepts from notes/readings
* [ ] Generating practice questions (not assigned homework)
* [ ] Unit checks / sanity checks / limiting cases
* [ ] Socratic hints (questions that guided my reasoning)
* [ ] Planning study schedule
* [ ] Other: ________

**8.3 Verification:** Describe one time you *verified* an AI output (units, notes, re-derivation, etc.).
**8.4 Next time:** One specific way you’ll improve your AI use next unit.

# Appendix A — “Bad vs Good” examples (what earns full credit)

## A1) Pattern diagnosis

**Bad:** “I make dumb mistakes. I need to study more.”
**Good:** “Under time pressure, I skip writing assumptions and jump into equations. On Midterm 1 Q4 I used the right formula but applied it outside its assumptions, which led to a wrong physical conclusion. The fix is to write assumptions before equations every time.”

## A2) Intervention plan

**Bad:** “I will be more careful and check my work.”
**Good:** “When I finish a multi-step problem, I will spend 60 seconds doing a unit check and one limiting-case check (e.g., what happens if distance doubles?). This would have caught my Q2 scaling error because the trend was physically backwards.”

## A3) Study plan

**Bad:** “I’ll review the notes and do practice.”
**Good:** “Mon/Wed/Fri: timed 30-minute mixed problem set (no notes). Tues/Thurs: rework missed problems and write a 5-item checklist of my recurring errors. Weekend: one full-length practice set under exam timing, then redo every missed problem from scratch.”

## A4) AI reflection

**Bad:** “I used ChatGPT to help.”
**Good:** “I used the Socratic Tutor to quiz me on Doppler sign conventions and it refused to give answers until I committed. I verified by checking against the course notes and by testing limiting cases (approaching vs receding). Next time, I’ll write my own first-pass explanation before asking for hints.”

# Appendix B — Error type menu (use this language)

* **Units** (dimensional mismatch, missing conversions)
* **Algebra** (symbol manipulation, dropped minus signs, wrong rearrangement)
* **Concept/model** (wrong principle, wrong regime, wrong physical model)
* **Sign/direction** (Doppler sign, vector direction, energy sign)
* **Assumptions** (circular orbit assumed, blackbody assumed, neglecting opacity, etc.)
* **Interpretation** (got a number but didn’t connect it to the physical story)
* **Time/pacing** (ran out of time, didn’t allocate effort well)

**Artifact Header (for course materials)**  
**Course:** ASTR 201  
**Module:** [TBD] (used throughout the semester)  
**Learning Objectives:** Practice scientific reasoning and evidence-based discussion (supports course learning outcomes).  
**Concept Throughline:** Observables → models → inference, with uncertainty as normal.  
**Math level:** Astro 201 (equations are allowed, but we always interpret symbols physically).  
**Mode:** Draft

## What is “Scholarly Engagement” (10%)?

In this course, your engagement grade measures something *real*: whether you are practicing the skills scientists use to build understanding together.

You earn Scholarly Engagement credit through:
- **iClicker participation** during in-class questions (often think–pair–share).
- **In-class group inquiry activities** (from *Learning Astronomy by Doing Astronomy*).
- **Socratic Seminars** (a structured discussion where we interpret a shared “text,” often a figure, spectrum, short excerpt, or dataset).

This is not “points for talking.” It’s credit for *doing the intellectual work* of astronomy in community.

## What “good engagement” looks like (examples)

During discussion, lab-style activities, or seminar, strong engagement sounds like:

- “My claim is ___, **because** the plot shows ___.”
- “I’m not fully sure, but I think ___ **under the assumption that** ___.”
- “Can we check the axis / units / trend again? If that’s true, then ___.”
- “An alternative explanation could be ___. What observation would separate them?”

You do *not* need to be loud to be engaged. You do need to be *evidence-based* and *constructive*.

## Socratic Seminar norms (how we talk like scientists)

In seminar, our goal is **shared inquiry**, not performance.

**1) Anchor claims in evidence.**  
If you make a claim, point to something specific: a line in the text, a feature in the figure, an axis label, a trend, a number.

**2) Name assumptions out loud.**  
Astronomy is inference under constraints. Assumptions are part of the job, not something to hide.

**3) Disagree with ideas, not people.**  
Use: “I interpret it differently because…” not “That’s wrong.”

**4) Share the airtime.**  
If you’ve spoken a lot, practice listening. If you’ve been quiet, try one contribution:
a question, a clarification, or one evidence-based claim.

**5) Let uncertainty be normal (but not vague).**  
Uncertainty is fine. Vague claims are not. Try: “I’m ~70% confident because…”

## Practical seminar roles (so everyone can contribute)

Depending on the day, you may be in an **inner circle** (speaking) or **outer circle** (observing + supporting).

Outer circle contributions that count as full engagement:
- Track where the group used **evidence** well (and where we didn’t).
- Notice **assumptions** that were stated (or missing).
- Identify a moment when someone **revised** their thinking.
- Offer one “what would we measure next?” question during the debrief.

---

## What hurts your Scholarly Engagement grade

- Side conversations during class or seminar.
- Phone use that distracts you or others.
- Excessive tardiness and/or absences.
- Dismissing classmates instead of engaging their reasoning.
- Speaking without evidence (repeatedly) after redirection.

## Academic integrity and AI tools

Your thinking matters here. **Generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, Claude) are prohibited for course-related assessments.**  
That includes any for-credit written seminar prep/reflections, if assigned. If you’re unsure whether something counts, ask before submitting.

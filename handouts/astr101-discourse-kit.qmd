## Evidence & Reasoning Sentence Starters

Use these in Socratic Seminar, think-pair-share, and group inquiry activities. The goal is not fancy wording — it's clear scientific thinking.

## Common Astronomy Inference Pitfalls

Astronomy is inference under constraints. These pitfalls are *normal* — the goal is to notice them early and build guardrails.

Use this sheet during problem-solving and seminar.

### 1. Mixing up what's measured vs what's inferred
- **Guardrail:** Write "Observable:" and "Inference:" separately.
- Example: flux is measured; distance is inferred using a model.

### 2. Confusing brightness with luminosity
- **Brightness (flux)** depends on distance.
- **Luminosity** is intrinsic power output.
- **Guardrail:** Ask: "Is this property distance-dependent?"

### 3. Treating a model assumption as a fact
- Examples: circular orbits, equilibrium, "standard candle," negligible dust.
- **Guardrail:** Say: "This conclusion holds *if* ____."

### 4. Over-claiming (data show X → therefore theory Y is true)
- Data usually constrain a *family* of models.
- **Guardrail:** Ask: "What else could explain this pattern?"

### 5. Ignoring selection effects ("what got into the dataset?")
- What you observe is shaped by detection limits and survey design.
- **Guardrail:** Ask: "What might be missing, and why?"

### 6. Forgetting units or axis scaling (especially log axes)
- A straight line on a log plot means something different than on a linear plot.
- **Guardrail:** Always write the units and identify linear vs log.

### 7. Confusing correlation with causation
- Two quantities can vary together due to a third variable or measurement bias.
- **Guardrail:** Ask: "What mechanism connects them? What would break the trend?"

### 8. Treating uncertainty as a footnote
- Uncertainty is part of the claim.
- **Guardrail:** Try: "I'm ~__% confident because..." and name your biggest uncertainty.

### 9. Single-figure tunnel vision
- A great plot can still be misleading without context (calibration, sample, method).
- **Guardrail:** Ask: "What information is missing that could change interpretation?"

## The most scientific question you can ask

**"What observation would discriminate between these explanations?"**

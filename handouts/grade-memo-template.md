## Part A — Self-Grading Summary (Required)

**Instructions:** Grade **each problem** on a **1–5** scale using the rubric at the end of this document (or the standalone rubric handout). Then write *one short justification* per problem.

| Problem | Score (1–5) | What went well (1 sentence) | What was wrong / missing (1 sentence) | Error type (pick 1–2)                                           |
| ------- | ----------: | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       |             |                             |                                       | units / algebra / concept / sign / assumptions / interpretation |
| 2       |             |                             |                                       | units / algebra / concept / sign / assumptions / interpretation |
| 3       |             |                             |                                       | units / algebra / concept / sign / assumptions / interpretation |
| 4       |             |                             |                                       | units / algebra / concept / sign / assumptions / interpretation |
| 5       |             |                             |                                       | units / algebra / concept / sign / assumptions / interpretation |
| 6       |             |                             |                                       | units / algebra / concept / sign / assumptions / interpretation |
| 7       |             |                             |                                       | units / algebra / concept / sign / assumptions / interpretation |
| 8       |             |                             |                                       | units / algebra / concept / sign / assumptions / interpretation |

**Total points (optional):** _____ / (8×5 = 40)
**Overall self-grade (optional):** _____ %

> If your HW has a different number of problems, add/remove rows.

## Part B — Corrections & Learning (Required)

Pick **one** problem where you lost points and do a short, high-quality correction.

**Chosen problem #:** ___
**Corrected solution (concise):**

* (Write the corrected key steps. You do *not* need to rewrite the whole problem, but show the steps that changed.)

**Why the original went wrong (diagnosis):**

* What decision/assumption/step caused the error?

**How you could have caught it earlier (verification):**

* Units check? Limiting case? Sign check? Scale estimate? Diagram?

**One concrete habit for next week:**

* “Before I finalize an answer, I will always ______.”

---

## Part C — Study Reflection (Required, brief)

1. **Time spent (outside class):** ___ hours
2. **What you did to study (specific):**

   * e.g., “Solved problems without notes,” “made a formula sheet,” “did 10 retrieval questions,” etc.
3. **What worked best:**
4. **What didn’t work / what felt confusing:**

---

## Part D — Collaboration Disclosure (Required)

**Did you collaborate with anyone?** Yes / No
If yes, list names + what you did together (e.g., “discussed strategy,” “checked units,” “compared final answers,” etc.):

* Name(s):
* Collaboration description:

---

## Part E — AI Disclosure (Required)

**Did you use any AI tools while working on this homework or grade memo?** Yes / No

If **No**, write:

> I did not use AI tools for this assignment.

If **Yes**, complete the fields below.

### E1. Tools used (check all that apply)

* [ ] Course NotebookLM Notebook (grounded in course materials)
* [ ] ASTR 201 Socratic Tutor (Custom GPT)
* [ ] Other AI tool(s): ______________________

### E2. What you used AI for (check all that apply)

* [ ] Clarifying concepts from notes/readings (study use)
* [ ] Generating practice questions (not assigned HW)
* [ ] Unit checks / reasonableness checks
* [ ] Debugging my reasoning (Socratic hints/questions)
* [ ] Planning my study schedule
* [ ] Other (describe): ______________________

### E3. What you did **NOT** use AI for (required statement)

Check all that are true:

* [ ] I did **not** generate homework solutions with AI.
* [ ] I did **not** paste AI-generated text/math into my submitted solutions.
* [ ] I did **not** use AI to rewrite or “polish” explanations I submitted for grading.

### E4. Evidence (required if AI used)

Provide **2–5 bullets** with enough detail to be auditable:

* Prompt(s) or a short description of what you asked:
* What the AI returned (1 sentence summary):
* How you verified or rejected it (units/limits/checking against notes/etc.):
* What you changed in your work as a result (if anything):

# Rubric (1–5) for Each Problem

Use this rubric for the table in Part A.

**5 — Correct + scientifically clear**
Correct result *and* reasoning is clear. Units are consistent. Assumptions stated or clearly implied. Work is readable and logically structured (all steps are shown).

**4 — Essentially correct, minor issues**
Core method and result are correct, but one minor flaw exists (small algebra slip that doesn’t affect final answer, minor unit formatting issue, missing a brief explanation, unclear step).

**3 — Partially correct, meaningful gaps**
Some correct reasoning is present, but there are significant gaps or mistakes (incorrect setup but some correct steps, incomplete solution, major explanation missing, unit handling inconsistent).

**2 — Attempted, mostly incorrect**
You made a real attempt, but the approach is largely incorrect or unsupported (wrong model/assumption, major conceptual error, work too incomplete to verify).

**1 — Minimal progress / not scorable**
Very little usable work shown, or work is too incomplete/unclear to evaluate meaningfully.

**0 -– No attempt**
No work shown.

> When in doubt: score based on **evidence of reasoning**. Invisible reasoning can’t earn high scores.

## Tips for Effective Self-Grading

<!-- TODO: Optional section with advice for students -->
* Be honest and critical. The goal is to learn, not to get a perfect score.
* Focus on understanding your mistakes, not just tallying points.
* Use specific examples from your work to justify your scores.
* Reflect on how you can improve your problem-solving process for next time.
* Keep it concise—clarity is more important than length.
* If you struggled with a problem, think about what resources or strategies could help you in the future.
* Use this as an opportunity to practice metacognition—thinking about your own thinking and learning.

## Detailed Per-Problem Self-Grading Rubric (1–5)

Use this scale to grade **each** homework problem during your Wednesday self-assessment.

**5 — Correct + scientifically clear:**

* Correct result and method used
* Units consistent throughout
* Assumptions/model stated or clearly implied
* Work is readable and logically organized (steps flow)
* Interpretation makes physical sense

**4 — Essentially correct, minor issues:**

* Correct method and result, but one minor flaw (small algebra slip, missing a short explanation, minor unit formatting, slightly unclear step)

**3 — Partially correct, meaningful gaps:**

* Some correct reasoning, but significant mistakes or missing pieces
* Examples: incorrect setup but some correct steps; incomplete solution; unit handling inconsistent; explanation missing enough to follow

**2 — Attempted, mostly incorrect:**

* Real attempt shown, but approach is largely incorrect or unsupported
* Examples: wrong model/assumption; major conceptual error; steps don’t connect

**1 — Minimal progress / not scorable:**

- Too little work to evaluate, or work is too incomplete/unclear to score meaningfully

**Principle:** Score based on **visible reasoning**. If reasoning isn’t shown, it can’t earn a high score.

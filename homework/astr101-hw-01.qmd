***Topics:** scientific thinking in astronomy • cosmic scales • units & scientific notation • “the sky is a map” • seasons misconceptions*

**Estimated time:** ~3-4 hours

## Why this homework exists (read this)

_This is not busy work._ Astronomy is a “reasoning from evidence” science, and the exams will ask you to explain and apply ideas — not just recall definitions.

This assignment is designed to:

- make the big ideas from Lectures 1–3 stick,
- give you repeated practice with the math tools you’ll use all semester,
- and help you build the habit of showing your reasoning (how you’ll earn points on exams).

### What to do

Complete the assigned Practice Problems from the end of the following lecture readings:

- **Lecture 1:** Spoiler Alerts — [Practice Problems]({{< meta params.website-url >}}/modules/module-01/readings/lecture-01-spoiler-alerts-reading.html#practice-problems)

- **Lecture 2:** Foundations / Tools of the Trade — [Practice Problems]({{< meta params.website-url >}}/modules/module-01/readings/lecture-02-foundations-reading.html#practice-problems)

- **Lecture 3:** The Sky Is a Map — [Practice Problems]({{< meta params.website-url >}}/modules/module-01/readings/lecture-03-sky-is-a-map.html#practice-problems)

Use the lecture pages for the full problem statements (located at the end of each lecture).

## Pro tips (to save time and pain)

- Start with the conceptual questions first, then do the calculations.

- When stuck, ask: **“What is observable here? What is inferred?”**

- Use **units** as your lie detector.

- Do a quick sanity check: is the answer the right order of magnitude?

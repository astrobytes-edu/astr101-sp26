***Topics:** scientific thinking in astronomy • cosmic scales • units & scientific notation • “the sky is a map” • seasons misconceptions*

**Estimated time:** ~3-4 hours

**Due:** Feb 2, 2026 @ 11:59 pm (1 week after this assignment is posted).

## Why this homework exists (read this)

_This is not busy work._ Astronomy is a “reasoning from evidence” science, and the exams will ask you to explain and apply ideas — not just recall definitions.

This assignment is designed to:

- make the big ideas from Lectures 1–3 stick,
- give you repeated practice with the math tools you’ll use all semester,
- and help you build the habit of showing your reasoning (how you’ll earn points on exams).

---

### What to do

Complete the assigned Practice Problems from the end of the following lecture readings:

- **Lecture 1:** Spoiler Alerts — [Practice Problems]({{< meta params.website-url >}}/modules/module-01/readings/lecture-01-spoiler-alerts-reading.html#practice-problems)

- **Lecture 2:** Foundations / Tools of the Trade — [Practice Problems]({{< meta params.website-url >}}/modules/module-01/readings/lecture-02-foundations-reading.html#practice-problems)

- **Lecture 3:** The Sky Is a Map — [Practice Problems]({{< meta params.website-url >}}/modules/module-01/readings/lecture-03-sky-is-a-map.html#practice-problems)

Use the lecture pages for the full problem statements (located at the end of each lecture).

## Problems to complete

### Lecture 1

> 1, 2, 4, 6, 8

### Lecture 2

> 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, 14

### Lecture 3

> 2, 3, 7, 8, 11, 12

## How to earn full credit

### 1) Show your work (always)

For any problem with numbers, your solution must include:

- setup (what you’re solving for)

- knowns/unknowns (what you’re given)

- equations or reasoning path (why you’re doing what you’re doing)

- units at every step (units are not decoration — they’re error-checking)

- a final answer that is clearly labeled (box/circle it)

If you only write a final number, you should **expect major point loss** even if it’s correct.

### 2) Explain your reasoning (conceptual problems)

For conceptual questions, write in complete sentences. Aim for:

- Claim: your answer

- Evidence/Reasoning: why (use the lecture ideas)

- Optional sketch: a quick diagram is often worth 10 sentences

### 3) Use diagrams like a scientist

For geometry/sky problems: draw a labeled sketch (Sun–Earth–observer, horizon/zenith, tilt, angles). You don’t need to be an artist—just be clear.

## What to submit

Upload **one PDF** to Canvas.

Acceptable formats:

- neatly handwritten work scanned to PDF (recommended, come see the instructor if you need help with this for the first assignment).

- typed solutions (PDF)

**Quality standard:** I should be able to read it without guessing what you meant.

## Collaboration and resources

- You may discuss ideas with classmates, but your write-up must be your own.

- If you worked with someone, add a short line at the top: “Collaborators: …”

- You may use your notes, the readings, and a calculator.

## Pro tips (to save time and pain)

- Start with the conceptual questions first, then do the calculations.

- When stuck, ask: **“What is observable here? What is inferred?”**

- Use **units** as your lie detector.

- Do a quick sanity check: is the answer the right order of magnitude?

## Help

If you get stuck, bring at least **one specific attempt** (a diagram, your setup, where you got lost) to office hours. Struggle is normal; *productive struggle* is the point.

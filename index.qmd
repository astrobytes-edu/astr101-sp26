## Welcome to ASTR 201

This is not a "tour of the cosmos" course. ASTR 201 is a **quantitative introduction to astrophysics** where you'll learn to think like an astronomer: extracting physical insight from limited observations using mathematics and physics.

Astronomers can't visit stars or hold galaxies in a lab. Instead, we measure light — its brightness, color, spectrum, and timing — and from these constrained observations, we infer masses, temperatures, distances, ages, and compositions. This course teaches you *how* we know *what we know* about the universe.

You'll develop skills in dimensional analysis, scaling relations, and order-of-magnitude reasoning that apply far beyond astronomy. By the end, you'll be able to estimate the mass of a black hole from orbital data, derive the temperature of a star from its color, and understand why stellar lifetimes span millions to trillions of years.

## What You'll Explore

::: {.grid}
::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-md-6}
**Module 1: Foundations**
Gravity, light, and the physics we need to decode stars from a distance.

**Module 2: Stellar Properties**
Measuring distances to stars, reading their spectra, and classifying them by temperature and luminosity.
:::
::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-md-6}
**Module 3: Stellar Structure & Evolution**
Where the elements come from — hydrogen fusing into helium, supernovae forging iron and gold, and the black holes left behind.

**Module 4: Galaxies & Cosmology**
The Big Bang, the first three minutes, dark matter, and why the universe is still expanding.

## How to Succeed

1. **Show your reasoning.** Steps, units, and assumptions matter more than final answers.
2. **Use feedback.** Homework and grade memos prepare you for exams.
3. **Ask early.** Office hours and the discussion board exist for a reason.
